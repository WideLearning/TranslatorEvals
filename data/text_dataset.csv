"The woman who died after falling from a bridge over the A21 has been identified as a Sevenoaks mum. Marta Kendle, 37, fell from the Gracious Lane bridge on the morning of February 19. Police were called to the carriageway around 6.10am and the road was promptly closed in both directions. Despite paramedics best efforts, Marta, who was originally from Poland, was pronounced dead at the scene. Kent and Medway Coroners office have confirmed an inquest into her death will open on Wednesday (February 27). Tributes to the mum were left at the scene and on social media. Friend, Jodi Cahill posted on Facebook: ""I will certainly remember you. I am sorry we did not see how lost and alone you felt. ""Be at peace dear Marta."" A floral tribute left at the scene said goodbye to the ""beautiful and kind soul"". It read: ""To a beautiful and kind soul, we are sorry we didn&apos;t see your pain. We will miss you always. ""Rest in peace Marta, Love from Lorraine, Colin and family."" The inquest will take place at the Archbishop&apos;s Palace in Maidstone and will examine the circumstances surrounding Mrs Kendle&apos;s death. Are you struggling or know someone who is? Watch our video below to find out how the Samaritans could help. Mrs Kendle&apos;s death prompted the setting up of a petition calling for higher railings along the Gracious Lane bridge by Sevenoaks Common - to prevent people falling and to protect drivers from below. By today (February 25) 4,500 people had signed. The same site was the scene of another death in July last year when Southborough woman, Angela Skinner, 54, also died after falling on to the A21.",https://www.kentlive.news/news/sevenoaks-mum-who-died-after-2582402
"messaging system designed as a plugin-based system. Doubtless the kopete people would disagree with me here, but I'd say that their project was utterly redundant. What advantages does kopete bring that could not have been submitted to gaim itself? Why go to the time and effort to independently develop two programs which do virtually the same thing? Now there are other, significant differences. Gaim uses the GTK+ toolkit. Kopete uses Qt. Gaim is primarily C, Kopete is C++. In fact Kopete is fairly tightly bounded to KDE, whereas I think Gaim is not so quite involved with Gnome. So we can reduce this redundancy problem to the problem of two desktops, if it is a problem. I'm not sure it is, after all competition is good and drives development. Is it that much of a problem that some coders have spent time and effort re-inventing the wheel anyway? Well I think it is a problem, unless you are heavily camped in either desktop. I'm not. When I develop a GUI application, I have to make a decision about which environment suits me best. I know there's more to it than that - Gnome has all that other stuff like Glib and KDE isn't just QT - but the GUI is a major consideration. So if I opt for (say) GTK+, will some QT zealot prefer to code an alternative to using my version? I run a mixture of Gnome and KDE applications. I use Konqueror as a web browser, Gimp for some graphic stuff, etc. The two toolkits are somewhat annoying because they do not interact particularly well. When I write a GUI app, I want the interface code to be as separate from the logic as possible, to make swapping them in and out as easy as possible. Don't code an alternative, write a new interface for me! Glade is a GTK+ interface builder. You use a drag-and-drop program to compose a UI, and it can generate the corresponding GTK+ code. You can save the project seperately as an XML application. What is really exciting however is the companion libglade. This library reads in the XML that Glade writes at runtime and constructs the UI from that. You therefore don't even need to necessarily use the UI builder to generate the XML if you don't want to. Perhaps you'll just translate a UI described in a different XML application. So why do I think this is exciting? Alter/tweak the UI at runtime, without a recompilation. Translate (via XSL) an interface description in a different XML application. I haven't looked at the design of the XML glade dialect much myself, it might be a nightmare; but at least that nightmare could be hidden behind a translation. Want a KDE version? Write a runtime, XML-interpreting UI builder for KDE! Argh! so this rant has gone off-track a little bit. What else have I got to cover?",https://jmtd.net/log/geek/linux/ui/
"CHARLES H. MEISNER, one of the prosperous and highly-esteemed business men of Birnamwood, Shawano county, was born in Newton township, Manitowoc Co., Wis., February 14, 1860, and is a son of Frederick and Magarette (Steltzer) Meisner, both natives of Germany. Frederick Meisner was born February 5, 1825, in Mechlenburg, Germany, and after the death of his father he, with his mother and the rest of the family, came to America in 1849, settling in Manitowoc county. Here the mother lived to the good old age, dying in 1888. The parental family comprised six children, namely John, Frederick, Joseph, Dora, Josephine and Mary. The mother of our subject was born in Bavaria about the year 1832. Her mother died in Germany, and about 1850 she came to America with her father and her three brothers; John, William and Nicholas—and three sisters—Mary, Cathrena and Lena. Her father was a farmer by occupation. Frederick Meisner had six children of whom Charles H., Frederick J. and Henry are living; William died when four years old; John when an infant, and a daughter, Bertha, when nine months old. This worthy couple at present reside on a farm purchased by Mr. Meisner some thirty-seven years ago, and which is situated near Manitowoc City. They are consistent members of the German Lutheran Church, and Frederick Meisner is a stanch Republican, although he has never taken a very active part in political matters. Charles H. Meisner was reared to the life of a farmer's boy, obtaining his education in the common schools, and assisting his father upon the farm until he was of age. He then spent several summers working upon a farm. In June, 1884, in company with John Roepke, he came to Birnamwood, where he bought out a store owned by Hunter and Cole, and organized the firm of Roepke & Meisner, proprietors of a general mercantile store. In 1889 they commenced the manufacture of lumber, buying and repairing a mill and furnishing employment to fifteen men, on an average. Both these gentlemen have built themselves handsome residences, and have dealt extensively in real estate, now owning some 1,300 acres of timber and farming lands. Charles H. Meisner was married January 4, 1884 to Miss Meta Pleuss, who was born in the same town and county as her husband. She is a daughter of Frederick and Mary (Levereriz) Pleuss, natives of Germany; who came to, America about 1850. The father; who was a farmer, died in 1877. They had a family of five daughters—Mary, Lizzie, Meta, Augusta and Minnie. Both the parents had children by former marriages. Mr. and Mrs. Meisner have no children. In politics our subject is a good Republican, but has always been too busy attending to his own affairs to become an office-seeker. However, his fellow-citizens have shown their appreciation of his worth by making him town treasurer, and electing him to the minor offices. He was postmaster for eight years, and is one of the trustees of the village. He and his wife are members of the German Lutheran Church, and are held in high esteem.",http://synergistic-technologies.com/biocmeisner.html
"EVER WONDER WHY SOME PEOPLE CAN WORK NIGHTS AND SLEEP EASILY DURING THE DAY? A new study from Tiina Pauno, a professor at the University of Helsinki, Finland found that many night workers actually have a variant in the genetic code that makes them less influenced by Melatonin and hence the circadian rhythm. They tested 577 shift workers and looked for a genetic changes for job-related exhaustion. The risk variant known as 1A(MTNR1A) gene basically turns off or on the DNA (through methylation). This is another fascinating epigenetic (a new field of genetics studying how our environment changes or genes) mechanism regulating function. The result people who can do this have less receptors and are not sensitive to melatonin and tolerate nights much better. The people with this gene variant can sleep in bright light without any difficulty as well. Hmm all those years you wondered why you couldn’t stay awake at a night job and your peers seemed to have no problems.

"It’s the end of the world,” said the caterpillar. “It’s the beginning of the world,” said the butterfly. In the life cycle of a butterfly, it starts out as an egg that turns into a caterpillar. Then it becomes a cocoon before it turns into a beautiful creature capable of fluttering free through the skies. The search for happiness is universal, and yet it is hard to find. Perhaps we are looking in the wrong place. Are You Chasing the Elusive Butterfly of Happiness?

"Stretch Therapy (ST) is a comprehensive system that includes stretching, fascia remodelling, strengthening, neural re-patterning, and relaxation. We can hep you ease tension and pain,help prevent injuries, increase your range of movement and adjust any imbalances. Our stretch therapy (AIS technique) allows the body to repair itself and also to prepare for daily activity. The AIS technique involves the method of holding each stretch for only two seconds. This method of stretching is also known to work with the body’s natural physiological makeup to improve circulation and increase the elasticity of muscle joins and fascia. The AIS method of muscle lengthening and fascial release is a type of Athletic Stretching Technique that provides effective, dynamic, facilitated stretching of major muscle groups, but more importantly, AIS provides functional and physiological restoration of superficial and deep fascial planes. AIS is important for injury prevention recovery, as well as performance enhancement. AIS is something that everyone can benefit from. One of the many things that makes AIS superior in dealing with flexibility problems is that it has no age and very few contraindication limits. It can be used by the very young and by the most senior of senior citizens. Other than typical sport massage techniques like deep tissue manipulation, pressure points, joint mobility etc. This modification allowing a combination of stretching techniques.

"A month ago, India had commissioned world’s first 100 percent solar-powered airport in Cochin. Recently, India’s greenest airport terminal at Chandigarh international airport in Mohali was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Built by Larsen and Toubro (L&T), the terminal, spread over 53,000 square meters, is designed in accordance with concept of green building. The terminal sets a new benchmark in sustainability by incorporating various green technologies. The terminal is constructed using over 55 lakh fly ash bricks and features cavity walls, double insulated roofing, energy efficient chillers, and a sensor-based plumbing system to save water. Such an extensive use of fly ash in construction of large structure is highly commendable. The terminal has achieved a 4-star GRIHA (Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment) rating. Unlike other terminals, this does not have huge displays that run on artificial light and consume huge amount of electricity. Absence of displays has helped in cutting down maintenance costs and running expenditures. The terminal does not require artificial lighting during day time owing to a transparent façade. Used glass on the façade is low-heat gain glass, which means it will automatically reduce the need for installing and spending on air conditioners. A lawn laid out right inside the terminal delivers a refreshing treat for passengers. The available air conditioners are equipped with sensors that can detect body heat for automatic activation. Rest of the time, the ACs remain in sleep mode to save energy. To meet the electricity requirements, a 200 KW solar plant is installed on the rooftop of the terminal. Solar plant generates enough energy to meet the major power needs of the building. For lighting during nights, 40 percent of the airport is illuminated with energy-efficient LEDs. The terminal also includes a sewage treatment plant with a capacity of 600 KLD. The treatment plant is based on environment-friendly extended aeration technology. The recycled water is reused for flushing and gardening. The airport terminal is one of its kind in India, may be in world too. It hasn’t received any name yet, but most likely it is to be named after Indian revolutionary freedom fighter Sardar Bhagat Singh. The new airport will facilitate neighboring states including Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir.",http://www.planetcustodian.com/2015/09/25/7695/indias-greenest-airport-terminal-constructed-from-55-lakh-fly-ash-bricks.html
"Stately palm trees reach to the blue sky. The city of Split, and majestic mountains, far off in the distance. Looking up from Trogir’s network of little streets. Cheery lemons await picking, or just admirers. A tiny church, off in the distance. Silhouette of Kairos (the god of the fleeting moment), modeled after a 3rd-century bas-relief found in the town. These are beautiful. Lucky you! Lucky indeed, Caitlin. When we walk out among the buildings adorned with coats of arms, strolling the city’s labyrinthine lanes, I have to pinch myself that I’ve been in such a special city for over a month. The friendly people here make Trogir all the more wonderful. Jen, I agree with you that perpetually sunny skies can get a bit overwhelming. I felt the same way this past fall, visiting sunny Nevada. Sometimes I just yearned for a rain cloud or two. I suppose the “grass is always greener.” I liked your line that once again the “blue skies hold magic” for you. Some great looking up shots, Tricia. Love the one between the houses, with the lamp in, and that cat shot is wonderful. Thanks, Jo! We do a lot of looking up here because a lot of the fun details are hidden up there. Tricia I so loved your blue skies today. It has been the usual 300 days of rain followed by a day of sunshine. This is the rain-forest area so we must accept the rain but right now I do believe I have webbed feet. V. Soon you’ll be admiring all the emerald beauty around you! Those date palms set against blue skies is something to be cheery about. What a beautiful place to choose for home away from home. How long is this stay? Lynne, I didn’t know that those were date palms! Thanks for providing that botanical tidbit. We’ll be returning to Germany/France in May or June. (We can only stay in the Schengen Zone for 90 days at a time.) Since tourist season will be picking up here in the coming weeks and months, we’ll probably flit on off to another home away from home. There are so many lovely options – Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania? Another spot in Croatia? We’ll see. I am sad at the thought of leaving Trogir, though, as we’ve met some really kind people and are starting to feel a bit like locals. Tricia Mitchell is spending some time in Trogir and exploring Dalmatia and she has written some very interesting posts, which are recommended reading! The blue skies are a striking background for all your beautiful photos. Everything looks good against a clear blue sky! My favorites are the flags. Hi Marilyn, blue is such a regal color – fitting for Trogir’s magnificent architecture! I also find the Croatian flag to be quite striking, especially contrasted with that column and centuries-old buildings. Mark, I have to pinch myself whenever I see so much vibrant life here, even during these late winter months. I am pleased to find you via “Our Adventure in Croatia”. Stunning pics! Tina, the feeling is mutual. Thanks for your flattering feedback and for visiting! In what part of Serbia do you live? I live in the South East. Near Nis. We are kinda distant neighbors. Indeed :) – we might be heading that way – we shall see. So much to explore in this region! How long have you lived there? This time it is a long term stay. (maybe permanent.). We only just arrived in Nov (2012). But we were here two previous times for 5 months each tip. I am getting my bearings. :) Very Challenging with a toddler! Wow, I can imagine how it must be challenging navigating new customs with a little one! Are you speaking multiple languages to your child? Yes, but she cannot speak yet. In time she will be bi-lingual. Ah, beautiful Tricia, croation skies are different than californian skies ,I can see. Enjoy! I’ll have to read up on why the color varies so, Cornelia. The winter light is of course quite different here on the seaside than in Germany. The winter side is usually more bluish,, and the place where you are is usually more yellowish and reddish, talking in photography terms. It all depends on the temperature and the reflection of the sky, just a simple explanation so far. I wonder why that part of the world has such intense blue skies! The puzzled cat and the soaring seagull are my favourite picks Tricia. I thought that too, Madhu.

"Congratulations, this is no B.S. free zone! Visual artists are visual thinkers! So we made anatomy books for artists. They don't want to read magnificent, but boring anatomy textbooks, stuffed with medical level information. Instead, the author made a book with clear images, that contain only the necessary information needed, to create a realistic human form. Most pictures in the book are self-explanatory. The text part of this book is only about 2%. The concept of this book came from co-author Uldis Zarins, classically trained sculptor, with 20 years of sculpting experience, looking for good visual anatomy book for his students, that would help to explain the forms of the human figure. After years of fruitless searching, Uldis decided to roll up his sleeves and take one for the team. So, he embarked on an epic quest to create a book for solid anatomical reference for any aspiring artist. The book contains images of various examples of different postures, such as a twisted torso, the movement of arms etc. This means you don't have to guess anymore how each muscle will look from any angle. ""A secret weapon"" to making a realistic human form. What sets apart good classical artists from others? Major factors are the skills and practice of course, but good live model makes a huge difference! If you have a good reference, you won’t need a live model anymore.

"The more times your children go under general anesthesia but it's not. This will be the 3rd time one of my children gets to experience this. It's really not that big of a deal, but I just feel bad there is nothing I can do to help, watching them wheel them away on the bed screaming, and then bringing them back asleep and waiting for them to wake up, which is never a pleasant thing if you have never experienced that. Unfortunately unlike Lucy he has had an infection that has been with him for a month, no antibiotic has cured it, not only that but the puss and fluid have not drained. So they will make an incision to let it drain before they put in the tubes the bad part is it's very painful, so the doctors tell me. Luckily Talmadge is a tough little boy, most of the time during his ear infections (9 since November) he never really cried, or woke up a lot at night, the only indication I ever has was a fever and loss of appetite. So hopefully he will not be to miserable when it's over. Oh! How not fun! It never DOES get easier to see your kids cry because they are scared or hurt. But at least he won't remember it, and it will help him out a ton in the long (and sounds like short) run. Poor little guy! I can not even imagine what he must feel like. I hope it goes well and solves all the problems! Good luck girl! Let me know how things turn out. Wish I could be up there. So nice to hear your Grandchild is having surgery on a blog spot!! Dad told me or I still wouldn't know. So much for concerned parents/grandparents. Amber you poor thing could anything else happen...Knock on wood.

"Thymoquinone protects DRG neurons from axotomy-induced cell death. OBJECTIVE: Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a significant health problem that is linked to sensory, motor, and autonomic deficits. This pathological condition leads to a reduced quality of life in most affected individuals. Schwann cells (SCs) play a crucial role in the repair of PNI. Effective agents that promote SC activation may facilitate and accelerate peripheral nerve repair. Thymoquinone (TQ), a bioactive component of Nigella sativa seeds, has an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties. In the present study, the neuroprotective efficacy of TQ was investigated by using a laser microdissection technique in a mouse PNI model. METHODS: Single cells were isolated from dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) of 6-8-week-old mice, maintained in defined culture conditions and treated with or without TQ at different concentrations. Axons were cut (axotomy) using a controllable laser microbeam to model axonal injury in vitro. Under fluorescence microscopy, cell viability was evaluated using the fluorescent dyes. The behavior of the cells was continuously monitored with time-lapse video microscopy. RESULTS: TQ significantly increased neuronal survival by promoting the survival and proliferation of SCs and fibroblasts, as well as the migration of SCs. Furthermore, TQ improved the ability to extend neurites of axotomized neurons. The regenerative effect of TQ was dose-dependent suggesting a target specificity. Our studies warrant further preclinical and clinical investigations of TQ as a potential regenerative agent to treat peripheral nerve injuries.

"Consider replacing the flapper and inspect the inside of the tank to see if there is any build-up preventing a proper seal. Also inspect the lift wire/guide to see if it is bent, corroded or catching on something, preventing the flapper from closing properly. The float arm needs to be adjusted so that the water level is 2"" below the top of the overflow pipe. The float arm may need to be repositioned to obtain the desired water level. If it is a plastic float arm, adjust the screw located at the top of the arm. Also make sure the refill tube is located about 1/4"" over the overflow pipe. If necessary, clip the tube to the overflow pipe to stabilize it and keep it from moving into the overflow pipe. Consider replacing or repairing the service line to prevent larger loss of water. A professional service may need to be contacted for completing this task. At this point, try to determine where the water is going inside the home. Finally, if all of the above tests show no evidence of leaked water, check the appliances that cycle. Water softeners can cause an increase in usage, so check the settings to make sure it is not cycling more often than necessary and monitor its full cycle to make sure it is operating properly. Also check outside spigots and hydrants to make sure they are not dripping, especially when connected to a sprinkler, soaker hose, or irrigation system. Take note of the times when extra water may be used, possibly weekends and evenings, when watering plants and gardens.

"Who am I? What's this all About? You could say I grew up traveling, when I was young I lived in Lagos, Nigeria with my family. Over the years I spent there we traveled to some of the countries you see highlighted in green. During these travels I saw the pyramids of Egypt, I summited Mt. Kilimanjaro, skied in the alps, learned how to scuba dive in Mauritius, and so much more. I was very lucky in this respect, but living in West Africa exposed me to some stark realities. I quickly came to understand that the world is a harsh place to most people. The struggle for survival is something real and a part of most peoples' everyday lives. It wasn't until later, that I decided to travel again. This time on my own. At the age of twenty, fed up with the mundane routine of my life, I decided to take some time off school and head south. From my home in Colorado I traveled to Belize, Guatemala, and El Salvador. I was interested in environmental science, ecology, and societies different from my own and this area of the world beaconed me. I fell in love with the culture, the people, fellow travelers and the Spanish language. I spent just a few months down there, but I left with a promise to return. After just a couple years I graduated with a degree from Colorado State University, and I fulfilled that promise. It's now been over three years of traveling and I am still living the transient life, as a writer, traveler, and outdoor guide. Where will I be going next? The concept of Tramp-N-Trekker is simple, its a blog about the intersect between outdoor enthusiasm and a loose footing lifestyle. Covering a wide range of topics like the cost of living abroad, backpacking meals, gear reviews, travel tips, musings from the vagabond lifestyle and my personal thoughts on all related matters. This is meant to be for anyone who wants to travel, regardless of location or duration. It is meant to inspire people to travel while offering the tips and tricks I've acquired from doing so myself. During my travels I will be backpacking into the mountains, forests and jungles of the world. Exploring iconic cities and small villages alike. Meeting new people, and doing whatever else comes my way.",https://www.trampntrekker.com/about.html
"A PROCEDURE assessed by NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) and used in research led by the University of Birmingham has been hailed as an exciting development in increasing the number of livers which can be safely used for transplantation. Liver transplantation is a highly successful treatment for end-stage liver disease, which kills 11,000 people a year in England. Deaths from liver disease have soared by 25 per cent in a decade and continue to rise, while the average age of death from liver disease (currently 50-59 years) continues to decrease. Today NICE has issued final guidance which recommends the procedure — ex-vivo machine perfusion for extracorporeal preservation of livers for transplantation — is used under special arrangements as more data is gathered into its efficacy. NICE’s independent advisory committee did not identify any major safety concerns. NHS England and commissioners will decide whether they fund the procedure. However research is already taking place at centres around the UK including studies by experts from the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Liver and Gastrointestinal Research in the Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre. University of Birmingham Honorary Professor Darius Mirza, Consultant Transplant Surgeon at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, said: “In the 30 years I’ve been involved with transplantation there have been three or four events which have been game changers and I’m absolutely certain we are looking at a game changer that will change the way we practice organ storage and transplantation. Sue Bennett, 45, a mother of three from Ranton in Staffordshire, had a liver transplant using this new technique in 2015. She said: “I signed up for the trial not knowing I would be one of the first to have this procedure in the country. Before my transplant I was very ill. I was losing weight, I couldn’t sleep and my quality of life was quite low. “Having a transplant has changed my life. I‘ve joined the gym, got fit and gone back to work and did some voluntary work for the Staffordshire Search and Rescue team and I also compete nationally and internationally in the Transplant Games as a member of the Team GB transplant team. John Forsythe, associate medical director at NHS Blood and Transplant, said: “There has been a huge amount of research in the area of preservation and perfusion methods that allow us to both assess precious donor organs and to enhance their function. This could potentially mean the organ works better and improve transplant outcomes. “Many of the lead researchers in the area of transplant preservation and perfusion techniques are in UK and it is good to see UK researchers continue to be at the forefront in this field. Vanessa Hebditch, director of policy at the British Liver Trust said, “Every year hundreds of people with advanced liver disease die whilst waiting for a transplant. “This new device offers real hope as it may improve transplant outcomes and allow livers that were previously thought to be unsuitable to be used and also increase the time that livers are able to be kept. For the financial year ending 31 March 2018, there were 1,043 liver transplants in the UK and 359 patients on the UK active transplant list, according to NHS Blood and Transplant. The number of patients on the active transplant list reached a ten year high in 2015 when 611 patients were on the waiting list. However the large drop attributed to the 2018 figure may be due to the introduction of the National Liver Offering Scheme (NLOS) in March 2018.",https://www.tamworthinformed.co.uk/perfusion-machine/

"Cluster comprises IBM's Opteron-based eServer 325 server and systems management software and storage devices that can run Linux and Windows operating systems. IBM on Tuesday announced a prepackaged and pretested cluster that is powered by Advanced Micro Devices Inc.s 64-bit Opteron processor. IBM, of Armonk, N.Y., is combining its Opteron-based eServer 325 server—which targets scientific and technical computing users—with systems management software and storage devices to offer a bundled package that can run Linux and Windows operating systems. The new offering, which will be available later this month or in early December, is part of IBMs eServer Cluster 1350, which also includes bundles based on the companys BladeCenter blade servers and two-processor x335 and x345 systems using Intel Corp.s 32-bit Xeon chips. Clusters comprise multiple servers tied together to create a supercomputing environment for users. In a related move, IBM last week announced that it was teaming with Corning Inc., the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration to develop high-speed, optically switched interconnects for supercomputers. The $20 million, two-and-a-half-year project is aimed at increasing network bandwidth by 50 times while at the same time cutting the costs of supercomputers. IBMs 325 systems, powered by 2GHz Opterons, give users a chance to run both their 32-bit and 64-bit applications on a single platform, which is important for mixed-use environments, said David Turek, vice president of IBMs Deep Computing unit. ""For many of these users, who have been left with a stark choice—you either run 32-bit or 64-bit—Opteron is an interesting bridge between the two,"" Turek said. ""Its an attractive proposition."" AMD, of Sunnyvale, Calif., has pushed Opterons ability to run 32-bit applications as well as it does 64-bit applications as a key differentiator between it and Intels Itanium architecture. The 64-bit Itanium chip maintains a limited amount of backward compatibility, which means that it does not run the 32-bit applications as well as it does the 64-bit software. With the latest Itanium 2 released this summer, officials with Intel, of Santa Clara, Calif., were promoting the companys IA-32 Execution Layer, designed to bridge that performance gap. Intel, which has pushed Xeon-based systems for 32-bit applications and Itanium for 64-bit computing, views the execution layer as a way of helping customers who want to move to 64-bit computing but still have older 32-bit applications running. On Monday, Intel officials said that a software update from Microsoft Corp. that includes the execution layer for Windows applications has been delayed until the second half of next year. However, they said that Linux vendors, including Red Hat Inc. and SuSE Linux AG, both are incorporating the execution layer code in their offerings. /zimages/3/28571.gifRead ""MS Delay Hinders Itanium Software Upgrade."" Gordon Haff, an analyst with Illuminata Inc., said Opterons adoption path is mirroring that of the older Itanium technology. ""Theres a lot of interest in Opteron in [the high-performance computing space]; its nearly exclusively in HPC,"" said Haff, in Nashua, N.H. ""Its a good performing chip, and thats pretty much what HPC [customers are] looking for."" While backward compatibility with 32-bit applications may make Opteron more attractive in the commercial space, HPC users are more interested in performance, he said. Turek agreed. ""The Intel name carries a lot of weight in the industry,"" he said. That said, HPC and technical computing customers tend to be among the early adopters of new technology. ""Theyre searching for the best technology without so much regard for the brand,"" he said. The Opteron cluster offering includes IBM Cluster Management Software, which aims to avoid problems and speed up the resolution of problems that do occur by automating repetitive tasks and error detection. Also included in the cluster package is a new Linux Cluster Install Tool, which automates much of the installation work, IBM officials said. In the supercomputing interconnect project, Cornings Science & Technology Division, in Corning, N.Y., will create a prototype for an optically switched interconnect. IBM Research Labs in the United States and Switzerland will build the systems electronic control and monitoring circuitry.",https://www.eweek.com/networking/ibm-takes-wraps-off-opteron-based-cluster

"After we left Zihuatenajo, needed fuel and water so we took a left turn in to Acapulco Bay. The Yacht Club is on the wind protected left side of the big bay, the rest of the shoreline looks like Miami, or Ft. Lauderdale, or Puerto Vallarta. Our first impression was to get what we needed and get out. It was crowded boats on the hook, mooring balls, and a lot of crap tied around the area. We found the marina and fuel docks, met with the management of the thing to get permission to buy some fuel and did just that. They didn’t even have any potable (drinking) water at the dock. (so they said). Turns out it is harder than you would think to find potable water from a hose. Normally, there is drinking water accessible via a water hose just like you have attached to your house. There isn’t a fee for the water since you are purchasing fuel. But we found that once we left Puerto Vallarta, we couldn’t find water until we were so far south that we were almost to Guatamala. The snooty factor in Acapulco is about a 9 on the 10 point snooty scale. Didn’t even drag a camera out. Acapulco helds no interest for us…so goodbye Acapulco.",http://gonebambu.com/?p=174

"Marketers are employed in the public sector as well as the private sector. Most people think of marketing as a strictly private sector activity, but the reality is people with sales and marketing backgrounds are hired by government agencies in a number of capacities. Government agencies at the local, state and federal level all employ marketing professionals in areas including, but not limited to, public relations, property disposal, bond sales and purchasing. Almost all major government agencies have their own public-relations staff, and in many cases it is a stand-alone department with a public relations or media director and several support staff. Government agency PR departments are responsible for producing news releases, holding press conferences, and generally promoting activities of the agency, such as tourism or encouraging new businesses to move into the area. Government agencies are constantly buying supplies, equipment and other property and selling off old equipment and property. The departments tasked with disposing of this government property often hire individuals with a background in marketing. Their job is to assist the agency in coming up with creative ways to sell or otherwise dispose of obsolete government property. Most government agencies have to follow complicated regulations for purchasing supplies and equipment. In many cases, agencies can only buy from certain suppliers or can only buy goods within specific price ranges. Agencies often hire purchasing agents with marketing backgrounds to help them manage their purchases, including setting criteria for suppliers and establishing price ranges. Government purchasing agents must be very familiar with current purchasing regulations at their agency. Local, state and federal agencies sometimes sell bonds to finance capital improvement projects in their jurisdictions. These agencies hire bond and securities marketing specialists to prepare bond prospectuses for investors, which detail the terms of the bond, and to organize marketing campaigns to sell the bonds. Bond marketing specialists also typically manage media relations for bond campaigns. Browne, Clayton. ""Are There Marketing Jobs in the Government?""

"hey. I can not start any programs because of the error ""Access denied"" (see photo). What can I do? To fix this it needs to implement a few permissions to wine and it should be installed to external storage.

Also create some new folder on /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/. Call this folder ""org.winehq.wine"" and add in there another folder like ""drive_z"".

"Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease that over time can cause vertebral fusion in the spine. This fusion makes the spine less flexible and can lead to a curved posture forward. When the ribs are touched, it can be difficult to breathe deeply. Ankylosing spondylitis affects men more than women. Signs and symptoms usually begin in early adulthood. Inflammation can also occur in other parts of the body, most often in the eyes. Ankylosing spondylitis cannot be cured, but treatments can reduce their symptoms and possibly delay the progression of the disease. It is a type of arthritis which especially affects the spine. Mostly men at their teen age get attack by this disease. Its actual causing reason is still unknown. But it is hypothesized that some genes like HLA-B27 may be responsible for developing this disease.",https://www.marham.pk/all-diseases/ankylosing-spondylitis/pakistan?feeRange=1000-2000&gender=female

"After an even enough opening half, after which Monaghan led by three points, 1-5 to 0-5 while playing with the wind, any hopes Kildare had of turning the game around disappeared soon after the restart with Monaghan opening with two quick points and then adding a second goal, when a long ball in was won by Donnacha Swinburne over his marker, he turned and fired to to net to leave it 2-7 to 0-5 with just 36 minutes gone in the second half.

"The enterprising and energetic Franklin Food Elves soon will be canvassing neighborhoods all around Franklin collecting goods during the “12 Days of Donating” campaign to benefit the Franklin Food Pantry. From December 1 to December 12, citizens can donate items in their own neighborhoods or at local participating businesses to help neighbors in need. The Food Elves is a charitable community service group made up of more than 60 students ranging from elementary through high school. For the past two years they have joined forces with the Franklin Downtown Partnership to operate the “12 Days of Donating” campaign with great success. This year the Elves aim to beat last year’s record-breaking collection drive by raising more than $5,700 and 4,200 pounds of goods. According to the Food Pantry, about 600 households are registered to use Pantry services. This year’s need will be even greater due to a decrease in SNAP benefits in November. Health and hygiene items are not covered by those benefits and are a particular need. In early December, Food Elves will notify their neighbors about the collection campaign, including what items can be collected and the collection dates. Residents simply place bags of goods at their mailboxes on the designated pickup day and the Elves will do the rest. Collection dates will be Saturday, December 7, Sunday, December 8, or Saturday, December 14. In case there’s no Elf in your neighborhood, it is still easy to donate. The Elves have placed bright red collection bins at participating Downtown Partnership member businesses. If the Elves meet their goal of collecting more than 1,200 pounds of goods, each business has pledged to donate $200. There will be a donation bin at the Holiday Stroll tree lighting ceremony at Dean College on Thursday, December 5, or you can drop off donations at the Food Pantry, 43 West Central St., and designate them for the “12 Days of Donating” drive.

"Editor’s note: The Consulate General of Belgium in Atlanta each month puts out a newsletter recounting its activities across the region and informing its compatriots about vital information from the foreign ministry. Follow the consulate on Facebook. As with each edition, this month’s included a spotlight on Belgian living and working in the consulate’s jurisdiction. Known as “The Belgian in the Picture,” the series aims to show just how deeply impactful the country’s economic and cultural engagement with the South is, despite its small size. The below Q&A is reprinted with permission and has been lightly edited for clarity and style. Belgian Consulate: Paul De Sloover, a veteran Belgian entrepreneur in the U.S., is being spotlighted in this month’s newsletter — appropriated given that his latest venture provides an innovative way to generate power from the sun. Mr. De Sloover, can you tell us more about the solar roof tiles made by Desol Power Tiles? Mr. de Sloover: Solar roof tiles are roof tiles with integrated solar panels. Instead of installing unsightly solar panels on top of an existing roof, with DeSol Power Tiles it is your roof itself that captures the sunlight. The tiles themselves look like regular classic Nordic style roof tiles, and when installed as instructed they form a completely sealed, walkable and hurricane-resistant roof. Belgian Consulate: What are other reasons more people are choosing solar roof tiles rather than solar panels? Mr. de Sloover: An issue a lot of people run into when they consider turning to solar energy, is that most home owners’ associations don’t accept the looks of large solar panels. Because our solar roof tiles don’t affect the aesthetic or architectural appeal of the roof, it removes that hurdle entirely. Belgian Consulate: With 31 years of experience as an entrepreneur in the U.S., what is your favorite aspect of doing business here? Mr. de Sloover: I would have to say the easy access to people and institutions, and the willingness of people to inform and help you in what you want to realize. And, of course, the advantages of the sheer size of the market and having unified regulations in that one big market. That is a definite advantage compared to Europe where every country has different regulations regarding solar roof tiles. Belgian Consulate: What would you tell a budding Belgian entrepreneur dreaming of taking his chances in the U.S.? Mr. de Sloover: Don’t dream, act. America, the United States, is a very open country. Spend time going to business fairs and talking to professional people. Do not assume that what works in Belgium will work in the States. Do your research. Belgian Consulate: How do you see the future of eco-friendly energy in the US? Mr. de Sloover: At this point there are two different schools of thought. Part of the people want to keep everything the way it is, and the other group of people wants renewable energy. Recent polls show that 73 percent of the American population believes in renewable energy. It will take time to get there, because this country, the United States, has an abundance of fossil fuels in its soil. But it also has an abundance of sunshine. So I would say, the future is bright.",https://www.globalatlanta.com/qa-rooftop-solar-without-the-panels-a-belgian-entrepreneurs-bright-view-on-the-future-of-renewables/

"Final Fantasy X introduces a new mini-game called, 'Blitzball'.

Each one of your teammates (which are NOT the main party members of FFX) has his own statistics, and depending on them and in your strategy, you will be able to win tournaments and/or leagues of the game. By doing this you'll receive rare items depending in which place you ended. HP - Hit Points. You use hit points for everything. From defending to shooting, the HP are like the stamina of your player.

However, the ""tree"" of knowledge of mathematics and related fields does not grow only by putting forth new branches. It also happens, quite often in fact, that branches which were thought to be completely disparate are suddenly seen to be related. Further, the kind and level of sophistication of mathematics applied in various sciences has changed drastically in recent years: measure theory is used (non- trivially) in regional and theoretical economics; algebraic geometry interacts with physics; the Minkowsky lemma, coding theory and the structure of water meet one another in packing and covering theory; quantum fields, crystal defects and mathematical programming profit from homotopy theory; Lie algebras are relevant to filtering; and prediction and electrical engineering can use Stein spaces. And in addition to this there are such new emerging subdisciplines as ""experimental mathematics"", ""CFD"", ""completely integrable systems"", ""chaos, synergetics and large-scale order"", which are almost impossible to fit into the existing classification schemes.

"I always love a good nosey into people’s bags – it kind of shows you a little bit more of their personality. This backpack is from Urban Outfitters which I actually picked up in the sale for the bargainous price of £20. I’m not one to carry around a lot of things with me on a daily basis – these are the main things I had. I had just bought the two Models Own nail polish featured above – Boots are currently having a 2 for £8 offer on them, so now is the time to snap some up. I’m looking forward to trying the Hed Kandi collaboration – a have seen it on a few friends nails and it looks fabulous. I always need some hand cream with me because I hate how dry my hand gets from using cheap soap at work – this works a treat. The superbalm from Liz Earle is really good for lips and any dry patches you might have – it works wonders on elbows! I am loving the new Revlon Lip Butters – I often find lipsticks really drying so this is a perfect solution. My sheep keyring was from the Mark Fast goodie bag I managed to grab while I was at fashion week – I like this little dude on my keys, don’t you? I just picked up this case for my phone and I love it – it made me feel like I had a whole new phone again.

"THE Greens are promising to double Fremantle’s tree canopy by 2040 under an “urban forest” plan. Freo council has already adopted a policy to increase the dire coverage of trees over barren streets, but Greens WA senator Scott Ludlam reckons the issue is so serious it needs federal attention. Perth’s lost 75 per cent of its bushland and about a third of what’s left is at risk. The Greens say this increases the intensity of heatwaves, which kill more Australians than any other natural disaster. Climate change modelling suggests there’ll be twice as many heatwaves in Australia by 2050. • $1.2 million a year to facilitate at least 10 per cent of buildings to have a “green” roof, wall or facade. This week the Greens took the party faithful through the policies and strategy for the coming election, with a green economy the main theme. The Greens want better investment in public transport, full renewable energy by 2030 and have committed to full social security. The party’s Fremantle candidate Kate Davis introduced the evening, which was held at Victoria Hall.",https://heraldonlinejournal.com/2016/05/27/greens-for-trees/

"ATPases belong to the class of acid anhydride hydrolases. The most common ATPases (24 proteins) contain the classical mononucleotide-binding motif, which is known as the P-loop or Walkermotif. A second subfamily exists as the GHL ATPase family, including Hsp90, PMS2, MutL and DNA gyrase B, and share the same left-handed β-α-β-fold. Four conserved sequence motifs have been identified in these enzymes. Finally, β-actin, Hsp70 and FtsA contain a more complex nucleotide-binding site and form the third and last subfamily of ATPases. The presence of various types of nucleotide-binding site in ATPases is of interest for drug discovery, as it might allow the design of compounds that specifically target only one type. The class of Heat-shock proteins (Hsps; EC 3.6.-.-), the molecular chaperones, comprises five major and broadly conserved families: Hsp100s, Hsp90s, Hsp70s, Hsp60s, and small heat shock proteins (sHsps). The stress proteins are typically named after their molecular size in kilodaltons. They are required for the correct folding and maintenance of client proteins in biologically active conformations, and to stabilize them against heat stress and toxic chemicals (particularly heavy metals). Although Hsps are ubiquitously expressed proteins, increased expression of Hsps in a stressed cell is mediated primarily by so-called heat shock transcription factors (HSFs, 1-4). Hsps bind adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and ATP hydrolysis is required for its function, and is the key driving force for conformational conversions within the chaperone. Although inactive heat shock proteins exhibit weak to nonexistent ATPase activity, the presence of a substrate peptide in the binding domain stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsps, increasing its normally slow rate of ATP hydrolysis,. In addition, a variety of co-chaperones, immunophilins, and other proteins are involved in the Hsp90-mediated protein folding pathway. ATPases as drug targets: learning from their structure. P.

"Our Palladium Tank Plating Kit – 1 Litre is a great option for re-plating white gold jewellery. The price of the kit includes 1 Litre of our Palladium Tank Plating Solution which contains 6 grams of palladium per litre and can be shipped outside the UK and EU, making it a good substitute for our transport restricted rhodium and platinum plating processes. Our Palladium Tank Plating Solution deposits a bright white, hard-wearing layer of palladium and is an excellent alternative to rhodium for re-plating white gold wedding and engagement rings. Another notable feature of our palladium plating system is that you can safely palladium plate items of jewellery that include materials such as pearl or coral without having to mask them out, as our Palladium Tank Plating Solution will not etch materials made from calcium carbonate. This was the case with the pearl and silver pendant in the picture; the whole of the pendant, pearls included, was immersed in our Palladium Plating Solution without any negative effect on the pearls. For a guide to setting up your Palladium Tank Plating Kit you can follow the same instructions for our Rhodium Tank Plating Kit which can be found in our Electroplating Manual by clicking HERE. This kit (or any of our other kits, equipment or solutions) is not suitable for plating on to aluminium or titanium and therefore can’t be used to plate iPhones and other similar products. If you are planning on palladium tank plating on to copper and its alloys including brass and bronze you’ll need to brush plate a barrier layer of gold flash to protect your tank plating solution. In between uses of your palladium tank plating solution, it’s a good idea to cover your solution with cling film to stop particles of duct and hair getting in as this will over time shorten the life of your solution. It will also reduce the frequency of having to filter your solution. Stepped voltage controlled via a selector switch enabling a range from 3 up to 12 volts. Maximum current is 3.0 amps. Perfect for powering the cleaning stage, removing the need to re-set the settings on your MF Rectifier from cleaning to plating. Palladium plating solution is agitated with a magnetic stirrer at the bottom of the beaker during plating. Mechanical agitation is a safer alternative to air agitation, as it eradicates any risk of the aerosol effect of the rhodium tank plating solution. Mechanical agitation keeps the plating solution moving over the surface of the item being plated in a consistent way, again maximising the efficiency of the tank plating process. Mechanical agitation avoids unnecessary oxidisation of the metal plating solution that air agitation will cause. Made bespoke from solid stainless steel and designed to be used in conjunction with the Plating Arm Clamp Fully conductive. Will not corrode and contaminate palladium tank plating solution. When used with clamp, can be moved up or down the stand in any position to fit any size of plating beaker. The advertised kit is using the 250ml kit. If you want to upsize to the 1 litre kit, you will need to remove the 250ml Plating Beaker, Mesh Electrode for 250ml Beaker, Stirring Bar (Mini) and 250ml of Palladium Tank Plating Solution from the kit list. You will then need to add the 1 Litre Plating Beaker, Mesh Electrode for 1 Beaker, Stirring Bar (Medium) and 1 litre of Palladium Tank Plating Solution.",https://www.goldn.co.uk/product/palladium-tank-plating-kit-1-litre/

"which relied too heavily on clichés and juvenile humor as characters had to explain everything instead of showing it (always a kiss of death for children’s animation) began to elicit yawns from the press row at the screening in just the opening twenty minutes as one prominent member promptly fell asleep. Upon its opening, we’re acquainted with three young flies, led by Nat McFly (as in “Think, McFly, think…” to steal a Back to the Future quote) who decide to tag along on Buzz Aldrin’s legendary Apollo 11 rocket mission in 1969. Featuring the voices of Christopher Lloyd, Kelly Ripa, Nicollette Sheridan, Tim Curry, Ed Begley Jr., Robert Patrick, and others, the film’s over-reliance on what they felt was a fascinating and relatable children’s plot involving the young insects bogs down the film which would have benefited greatly by focusing exclusively on the astronauts. This is especially apparent as it seems both completely awkward and like some strange “surprise party” styled prank on the audience in the film’s conclusion when heroic Buzz Aldrin himself walks out during the end titles to discredit every single thing that had transpired in the fictitious animated adventure, most likely to distance NASA from what can truly be called a cinematic waste of “space.” So, in other words, grab a swatter and some bug spray as that'll teach kids to imagine that houseflies have ""the right stuff.",https://reviews.filmintuition.com/2008/08/fly-me-to-moon-2008.html
"There is a lot of discussion right now about stress reduction. Today we see an increased work load of mental health professionals, increased occurrences of abuse or violence faced by social workers and other therapists, and the terrible struggles facing our returning veterans. All of these things have increased our awareness of the stressful elements of our society and the impact those elements have on both our clients and the professionals whose job it is to help. As a social worker I am aware of the impact of work related stress on me, my family and my ability to do my job effectively. In my exploration of this topic, I found the blog of a young British social worker who wrote a blog called “Fighting Monsters.” She has since closed the blog, for personal reasons she did not disclose. But I was very struck by the quote she references while explaining the name of her blog. “Be careful when you fight the monsters, lest you become one.” Nietzsche. For her that was about the monster “mental disorder and illness.” For me it applies to all of the various ways we want to help and give care. If we don’t pay attention, we will fall into the very trap we are trying to help our clients climb out of. Stress, anxiety and depression are the most common warnings of the beginning fall. As professionals who work to support clients facing any number of difficult challenges, we need to be sure we have the appropriate tools to manage stress. But knowing stress is a problem and doing something about it are frequently two different things. It’s a bit of the forest from the trees problem. When we are standing in the middle of the stress we really think we are handling it quite well. If we can step back a few steps, we frequently find that we are doing a pretty poor job of it. The most amazing part of this discussion, is that everything we use when we talk with clients are things that are available to us as professionals – and vice versa. Everything we talk about in these articles on stress are important for clients and therapists alike. There are four important elements in any stress management approach – TALK, WRITE, THINK, MOVE. The next four posts will take them on.",http://underduesocialservices.com/wp/2015/09/18/the-stress-of-caring/

"If you only focus on the graphics design of your web site and nothing else, you may have a beautiful web site that is hard to be found. If you only focus on search engine optimization and nothing else, your web site may be friendlier to the web robots at Google than it is to your web site visitors, which can hurt your conversion rate. If you only focus on social media and nothing else, you may not get the return on investment you are looking for. Web design, SEO, and social media are 3 important components of a successful Internet marketing strategy. If you want visitors to find you, you need outstanding SEO. If you want them to contact you or purchase from your site, you need great web design. If you want to create a lot of word-of-mouth recognition or implement a viral marketing campaign, social media can be an excellent tool for you. As a business owner, you should know that there is no one-size-fit-all online marketing strategy. There may be a lot of buzz on social media, but it may or may not be right for your business. This is why we always start by reviewing your business goals. When clients ask us: “How much should I spend on SEO? Should I create a Facebook page for my business? Do I need to redesign my web site? Is pay per click right for me? Should I start a blog?” Our answer is it only makes sense if it relates to your business goals. What are your business goals? What is currently working and not working for you? How are you attracting new customers? How much are you spending on each of these avenues? What percentage of your new customers comes from each of these avenues? How are you retaining your existing customers? What methods are you employing to encourage repeat purchases? What is the primary goal of your web site? To attract new customers? To service existing customers? To test a new market segment? What are you currently doing with your online marketing? How does this fit within your marketing strategy? How does your marketing strategy fit with your overall business goal? And how does your business goal fit with your lifestyle goal? Only by taking a look at the big picture can we help you answer questions such as how much you should spend on SEO or whether you should do social media. A marketing strategy that works wonders for someone else may or may not be right for your business or your lifestyle. This is the reason we have 2 departments: the technical people who are experts at SEO, social media, and web design, and the business consultants who can help you review and design the marketing strategy that is right for you. Many of our business consultants are business owners themselves and have tested various marketing strategies in their own businesses, so they speak from experience rather than a memorized sales pitch. More importantly than knowing the relative importance of web design, SEO, and social media is having a coherent marketing strategy that fits your business objectives and lifestyle goals. Only then can you confidently achieve the return on investment you are looking for.",https://www.freelancerbabu.com/blog/web-design-vs-seo-vs-social-media/

"I have been living and working in Médecins Sans Frontières’ hospital since the clashes began in March. I’ve only been able to leave the hospital twice since then. The first time was to refer a patient to a specialised hospital as his life was in danger. Thankfully, he is now alive and well. The second time was to participate in the burial of a dear friend who had died. He was an administrative employee in a local hospital but was working as a volunteer to provide first aid to the injured. One day, he was transferring an injured patient to the hospital. The car was going fast—there was no ambulance and they were using an open pickup. My friend fell from the car and was taken to a hospital. I was not able to visit him, as I was busy here; we were receiving many cases and it was important for me to stay in order to supervise the nurses, nursing assistants, cleaning staff, and others. On the third day after his injury, I received news of his death. The second time I went outside the hospital was to say farewell to my friend and participate in the burial. He was a pleasant, hard-working and brave person. My family left with our neighbours to an area outside Aden for their own safety. I wasn’t able to see them or say goodbye. My house is not far from the hospital, about 3km away, but it feels like thousands of kilometres. I cannot go and check if everything is OK there. I heard from some neighbours that our neighbourhood has been affected by shells, but I don’t know the condition of my house. Is it locked? Have the windows been broken? Has it been robbed? All I do is work and eat and take some rest if I can. Often, I try to sleep but am woken by an emergency and have to make sure everything is going as planned in order to receive the injured. We are still receiving significant numbers of patients despite the fact that many have difficulties reaching the hospital. Some patients told me they had to pay 10 times [more] for transport compared with prices before the clashes, so they are the ones who make it to the hospital. So, for a trip that used to cost 500 Yemeni rials (about $2.50), some people are now paying 5,000-6,000 rials to come to the hospital. This amount is difficult to afford in the current circumstances, especially as so many people have not received their salaries due to the bank and post offices and foreign exchange centres being closed, and the extreme difficulty of movement in the city. Food and water are additional problems, besides fuel shortages and the deteriorating security situation in Aden. Some of my neighbours say that they are taking two meals and sometimes only one meal a day after having to wait in long queues to buy food. It is the same problem with water, with people having to queue with jerry cans. We are facing all this in the hot summer of Aden, which gets hotter every day. Though we usually have food for the people in the hospital, sometimes we face problems providing it as we cannot go out. Restaurants and grocery stores are closed in areas where there are clashes. Our biggest fear is that the fighting will surround the hospital. Many times, when the clashes intensify, we go down to the basement. But this creates a different problem. Before we save ourselves, we move the patients who are in beds near windows to a safe place. This has happened many times. We hear the sound of gunshots and shelling or air strikes and we move all the patients to safe areas before finding a safe place for ourselves. Windows at the hospital have been broken more than once and bullets have entered, but no one has been hurt inside the hospital. Some of our medical team in Aden have lost family members due to the fighting. Some have lost a father, a brother, a friend. Sometimes members of the team leave the hospital to check on their families and we hear nothing about them for a week or two due to the bad telecommunications coverage or the unstable security situation, which forces them to stay home. I have no idea how long things will stay like this. I am very sad to see what has happened to Aden. A friend of mine tells me that I will not believe my eyes if I go to the Crater district of Aden now. Crater is my favourite place in Aden and I have many beautiful memories of being there. We have to forget about our pain and motivate ourselves to continue working and providing healthcare to patients.

"Download a standard PAGB booking form. In recent years there has been a tendency for clubs to deviate from using the standard booking forms and change to an email based booking system. Whilst we still recommend using a standard form, if you deviate from this as a club, you must ensure that the Lecturer or Judge receives all the information that is on the standard booking form. Lecturers and Judges who do not receive adequate information may decline the booking. Simply sending an email is not enough – you must ensure that you have also received a reply in order to ensure that your booking is made securely. From time to time clubs like to create a flyer or a blog post about a forthcoming lecture, illustrated by an image by the guest speaker. Please ensure that you ask permission of the speaker and don’t just take an image from his/her website. Most speakers will supply an image or two if asked! Reminders should be sent at least 10 days before the event. Please ensure that your Judge/Lecturer knows how to get to your venue, where to park and that final arrangements are made. When should expenses be agreed? The club must ensure that all expenses are agreed at the time of booking. What may Judges and Lecturers charge? Listed L&CPU Judges and Lecturers are restricted to charges set by the PAGB below. Fees. In the L&CPU, our approved lecturers and judges do not charge a fee in addition to their travel expenses. Some other organisations make lectures and workshops available for Clubs, where the cost may be partly or wholly covered by sponsorship. Details are in some Federation and the PAGB Handbooks. Clubs may engage judges and lecturers not listed by a Federation or the PAGB on any mutually accepted terms. These should be agreed at the time of booking. The L&CPU judges list is now divided up into sections. PAGB judges are those who have been invited to be listed on the PAGB’s own Judges List. They are judges who have experience of judging at higher level than club internal competitions. This would include judging at federation and/or Open Exhibition level. It is desirable that they are exhibitors themselves and are conversant with current standards and quality at open Exhibition level. Accredited Judges are those who have taken part in the accreditation scheme and have received positive feedback from clubs – they have also attended a seminar or judge training session since the scheme was introduced. Standard Judges are those who have not been through the accreditation scheme. Many of these judges are very experienced. The accreditation scheme is voluntary for all but new judges. New judges are added to the list from time to time and they appear in a separate listing so that clubs are aware that they have recently joined the list. All new judges will have been selected at a training session and will be expected to take part in the accreditation scheme. As the accreditation scheme is not compulsory for all judges, please only give feedback for those judges who request it. Where possible, keep a parking space free for your guest, close to the entrance. Please have someone to meet your speaker and help with carrying boxes/equipment. Please ensure that there is also someone available at the end of the meeting to give whatever help is needed. Please offer a drink beforehand and at any interval. Most lecturers and judges prefer to have their expenses paid in cash. Cheques for small amounts can be a nuisance, especially if the person’s bank is several miles away. Ensure that a formal vote of thanks is given at the end of the meeting. Ensure that the lecturer/judge does not have to ask for his/her expenses! Lecturers and judges are encouraged to report to the Lecturers and Judges Secretary any disregard of these conditions.",http://lcpu.org/lcpu-booking-judges-and-lecturers/

"[Weekly 4koma] Can you see the crazy? Original character, Yuukin! It may not be February, but love is still in the air. Any girl would be excited for Christmas because that’s when boyfriends prove their worth! But there are always worries that go along with a season that makes you think of love – does he like me, is he being faithful, do we spend enough time together? Honestly, the only solution to all of these problems is to lock him up and tie him to a chair to make sure you two will be together… FOREVER! Moving on from all of the tsundere, we are happy to introduce another original character, Yuukin Aikyou. She is just like any other girl – caring, loving, sweet and will make sure that she does whatever is necessary to keep you two together. Hear that? Whatever is necessary. Yanderes are most commonly characterized by their crazy side, be it in love or otherwise. Check out this 4koma for a first hand example. Watch out, because Yuu is possessive of everything. But our yandere, Yuukin, did not gain this personality by chance. Her father was often away on business trips which left her mother always alone. To make matters worse, her mother did not understand Japanese and ended up ostracized from her community due to her foreign appearance. Over the years she developed a tendency to go into hysterical fits of depression and anxiety because of her isolation. All the meanwhile, their daughter grew up with misaligned values and a warped idea of what love is. It seems like Yuu gained these “yanderu” tendencies by absorbing the negative emotions of her household, which eventually fell apart right before she got into middle school. It’s certainly ironic that their family name is Aikyou (愛嬌), which means attractive and pleasant.

"Today’s blogger is Amy Norton, our behind-the-scenes editor. If word choice were an Olympic sport, she’d get the gold. Thanks to Amy for writing today’s post on the newest fashion destination in Nashville: Anthropologie Shoes and Accessories. What is it about spending a little time in Anthropologie that seems to soothe the soul? Mine, anyway. Whenever I need a pick-me-up (i.e. Winter 2011 – all of it), a quick spin through this favorite haunt always seems to lift my spirits. Doesn’t matter if I leave with the smallest of trinkets –maybe a candle or new pair of earrings– or an entire outfit purchased in anticipation of a new season. Although I might skulk in as Madame Frump, I always skip out feeling a little bit new again. And discovering a different way to reframe myself makes me happy to contemplate the contents of my closet again. Having just attended the grand opening of Anthropologie’s Shoes and Accessories Boutique in the Mall at Green Hills last week, I’m thrilled to know that all of my discretionary spending will now be trackable to one place. (Who needs groceries anyway, right?) Since I was a child, I’ve had a fetish for accessories, and Anthro’s newest store is brimming with amazing adornments from all around the world (not to mention our own back yard) in the form of jewelry, handbags, scarves, belts and shoes. Anything you need to elevate your standard issue jeans-and tee from “wah” to “wow” can be found here. Just take a seat on the emerald green velvet divan in the shoe gallery and soak up the visual feast of all the baubles around you and you’ll see what I mean. Vintage sunglasses. Never worn, discovered in a warehouse by an enterprising buyer. How about a little old fashioned needlepoint as a case for your iPhone? Love it. Whimsy and design courtesy of Virginia Johnson. Whether it’s vintage jewelry or custom handbags designed exclusively for the company, Katherine’s buyers literally travel the globe in search of the treasures they know their customers want. Says Katherine, “From Nepal to Ecuador, we find artisans in the craziest places creating amazing things…and the cohesive nature of our collection comes from knowing our clientele and buying for their particular aesthetic.” Note: 20% of the merchandise in the Nashville store is unique to this city, and 50% is unique to Anthropologie. So if you’ve ever wondered how a chain retailer can have stores dotted across the globe and feel different in each locale, now you know why. A Case Study in Vintage Jewelry You’ll Only Find in Nashville. Reminds me of things I have from my grandmother’s jewelry box, only better. No pinchy clip-on earrings. Anthropologie Accessories offers jewelry lines from six local designers, one of whom is Kari Beth, pictured here by a display of her vintage jewelry. And if she looks familiar, that may be because you’ve shopped with her at the Anthro store in the Hill Center. Worlds collide! Company-wide, from the designers, to the buyers to the sales associates, Anthropologie focuses on making the impossible find possible and offers endless and as-yet unimagined possibilities for creative self-expression. Sounds more like an art gallery than a retail chain, right? Precisely. Insider Shopping Tip: We’re told to always ask if there’s stock in the back not out on display. Anthropologie constantly receives new merchandise. All you have to do is ask what’s new. Don’t miss the StyleBlueprint huge $1,500 giveaway this week featuring Jamie, AshBlue, Judith Bright and H. Audrey as we celebrate Lexus Nashville Fashion Week. For details, click here.",https://styleblueprint.com/nashville/everyday/anthropologie-ethos/

"The massage controller runs the shoes and pads. The device comes with 12 different massage modes/stimulations. The machine comes with an additional cable which allows you to massage two people at the same time or to use 4 pads or 6 pads on your body at the same time. The controller runs off a lithium battery that does not need to be replaced and once fully charged will give you 15 plus massage hours. The device works on a frequency of 1 to 100 MHz. The massage pads are designed to send bioelectrical pulses through the body to effectively ease the pain and fatigue of the area. They are easily applied around the body and is very practical for those who sit behind a computer or desk all day. It is also suitable for people who travel a lot to ease tension in their shoulders and neck. The size of the pads allow you stick them all over the body except for your temples and heart, so it is great for any injury. The massage belt works on the exact same principles as the pads, however it covers a larger area of the body . Therefore its fantatstic for lower to upper back problems, ITB, pulled hamstring or calf muscles or if you want tone up those tummy muscles.

"Military architectural designs are often overlooked in vernacular architecture due to the widespread use of standardized plans at military installations. However, factors including climate in certain regions force the development of new designs for military bases that are better suited to local conditions. This is arguably the case for the Panama Houses of the former Charleston Navy Yard, which are an example of a vernacular building type imported from a foreign context. While scholars have looked from a broad perspective at the Navy Yard and the more prominent structures, no study has been completed considering the history and form of the Panama House. Bringing together architectural evidence from this group of buildings and U.S. housing in the former Panama Canal Zone, this study explores the origins of the Panama House and the factors that brought it to Charleston, ultimately positioning this vernacular form within the context of the region and United States military installations.",https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/all_theses/2681/

"While you cannot accurately predict everyone who may present a risk of workplace violence, perhaps you can anticipate and head off some incidents. Many workplace violence episodes are related to non-work issues and may include family or marital conflict, divorces, and child custody disputes. And if served with legal process while at work, an employee may use violence to take out such frustrations towards bosses and colleagues simply because coworkers are nearby. We recommend you develop specific training based on your work setting, location, and security layout, as well as general situational awareness.

"BOSTON -- A disastrous 8th inning handed the Cubs a 6-2 loss to the Boston Red Sox on Sunday night, and it also gave the Red Sox the 2-1 series win. Cubs 42-year-old relief pitcher Koji Uehara (L, 0-2), pitching for the second day in a row, gave up three consecutive singles to start the bottom of the 8th with the game tied at 2. He was relieved by Pedro Strop who gave up a run on a wild pitch and another run on a groundout. Two more runs scored when Anthony Rizzo was unable to pick Addison Russell's throw out of the dirt at first base. Chicago was unable to get anything against Boston closer Craig Kimbrel in the 9th and fell to 5-4 on the 10 day, 9 game road trip. ""I'll take a 5-4 road trip. I will. I'll take a winning month. I will,"" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. ""We are not clicking on all cylinders yet. We had opportunities to score more runs early and didn't do it. But overall I thought it was a really good road trip."" Matt Barnes (W, 3-0) picked up the win in relief for the Red Sox, pitching a perfect eighth inning. The Cubs tied the game in the seventh inning when Jon Jay scored from on a wild pitch that the catcher could not find. Kris Bryant hit his 69th career home run and his fourth this season in the fifth which cut the lead to 2-1. The home run also extended Bryant's hitting streak to 11 games. Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks was effective, pitching 6 innings giving 3 hits, 2 runs, 3 walks with 6 strikeouts. However, one of the three hits allowed by Hendricks was a long 2-run homer in the first from Hanley Ramirez to continue the Cubs' trend of giving up runs early. Chicago will return home on Monday to take on Philadelphia at 7:05 PM CT.

In all the debate through the years about the cause in the rise in c-section rates, the role money plays gets little attention. The public is loath to think that the cesarean section being performed on a loved one results from the physician needing to make a boat payment rather than patient need. The doctors, of course, blame the lawyers claiming that lawsuits make the doctors do more cesarean sections to protect themselves from litigation. In an interesting new study available from the Social Science Research Network, MIT and University of British Columbia researchers analyzed records of births in California and Texas and have found that when the patient is a physician she is 10% less likely to receive a c-section delivery. The authors conclude that financial incentives are most likely responsible for this behavior. Post a Comment to ""New Study suggests doctors do more cesarean sections because of money.

"At an Ethnicity and Health Research conference in Edinburgh in November 2012, NRS’s Vital Events Statistician mentioned the possibility of matching census and ‘deaths’ records. The full presentation can be found on The statistics that have been published section of this website. In April 2014, the Director of Public Health Science at NHS Health Scotland and two Professors of Public Health wrote to NRS, to ask it to match the ethnic information that was provided when deaths were registered in 2012 with what was recorded in the 2011 census for the same people, in order to assess the accuracy of the information that was recorded at death registration (and also to carry out similar work in respect of later years’ deaths, in order to obtain an ongoing measure of the quality of the data). The data linkage part of this project was the first such piece of work done by the newly-established Data Sharing and Linkage Service, which is now part of the Scottish Informatics and Linkage Collaboration. As a ‘pilot’ project, it took much longer than would now be the case because of the need to establish various sets of rigorous governance, administrative arrangements and technical procedures. Not until May 2016 could NRS link together the ethnicity data from the death registration records for 2012 (and 2013 and 2014) and from the Census records (if any) for those people. A report on the results of the analysis was published on 14 March 2017. The report concluded that the data on the ethnicity of the deceased person were not (at present) suitable for calculating reliable mortality rates for most ethnicities. It identified some ways that NRS could try to improve the quality of future data. The full report is available in The quality of the data for 2012 to 2014 section of this website.",https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/deaths/deaths-background-information/ethnicity-of-the-deceased-person/further-background/the-first-assessment-of-the-quality-of-the-data-that-are-collected

"An eagerly awaited report from the World Health Organization (WHO) states that processed meats such as bacon and sausages cause cancer, and red meat likely does so too. The France-based International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the WHO, put processed meats on the top of their “things that cause cancer list”, grouping them alongside tobacco, asbestos and diesel fumes, for which there is “sufficient evidence” of cancer links. Along the years, there have been many studies that linked processed and red meats with cancer (especially bowel cancer), but there were always some doubts floating about. Now, the 22-member panel analyzed animal experiments, studies of human diet and health, and cell mechanisms that could lead from these meats to cancer. The decision wasn’t unanimous though, and a “probably” still crept in to the report. Many studies show the links, both in populations of people and in tests that show how eating these foods can cause cancer, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) said in its report, released in the Lancet medical journal. This could give you cancer. Photo by Niklas Rhose. “Overall, the Working Group classified consumption of processed meat as ‘carcinogenic to humans’ on the basis of sufficient evidence for colorectal cancer,” the report reads. “Additionally, a positive association with the consumption of processed meat was found for stomach cancer. The Working Group classified consumption of red meat as ‘probably carcinogenic to humans’,” it added. “The experts concluded that each 50 gram portion of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 18 percent,” the IARC said. “For an individual, the risk of developing colorectal cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but this risk increases with the amount of meat consumed,” said IARC’s Dr. Kurt Straif. Red meat was included in a lower category, which means that while there is evidence for it causing cancer, there is still quite a lot of room for debate. But while processed meat seems to be decidedly bad for your health, not everybody is convinced about red meat. The $95 billion U.S. beef industry has been preparing a retaliation for months, and they’ve been rallying numerous scientists to their cause – even some unafililiated with the meat industry. For now, the takeaway seems to be this: you need to stop eating processed meat. They have a number of damaging effects, including elevating stroke risk, raising cholesterol and, of course – cancer. If you absolutely can’t give it up, then reduce it. Quantity does matter, and less is, while not ideal, better than more. The same goes for red meat – if you must have it, don’t have it every day. It’s not sustainable, it’s bad for the animals, and it’s bad for you. We’re getting to a point where science is starting to understand what’s good for us and what’s not. Let’s make the science count, shall we?",https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/processed-meat-red-cancer-26102015/
"Home>Music> Janet Jackson & Daddy Yankee Perform ""Made For Now"" On ""Tonight Show"" Janet Jackson continues to build upon her already storied legacy. The Jackson sister dropped off a new single called ""Made For Now"" featuring Daddy Yankee earlier this week, and the duo decided to take their talents to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. It was Jackson's first late-night appearance in 14 years. Unlike most performers, Jackson took over the entire set. She remodeled the stage with dazzling set pieces, and brought along a crew of dancers and musicians to complete the performance. Much like the music video, Jackson uses dances from Ghana, Nigeria, Grenada, Trinidad, and the United States to give the performance a worldly vibe. In an interview withiHeartRadio, Jackson revealed that she has had a passion for Latin music for some time. ""I've always loved Latin music, and obviously, the African music is there and always been an influence,"" she stated. ""Coming from what Daddy Yankee does in reggaeton, it's inspiration. It's reggae music, which brings you back to the African vibe, the whole bit. It was really nice working with him. Growing up with different bodies of music [and] having so many kids in the family, I've been fortunate enough to have an eclectic library of music. [I'm] just doing something different that once again has been a love of mine, but still trying to do different things.""

"The Shirley Shaker Village, in Massachusetts, was founded in 1793 after a land donation from four benefactors - Nathan Willard, Elijah and Ivory Wildes, and John Warren. The village developed into three families: the Church, North, and South. By 1853 it had 150 individuals. Of the original 26 buildings, 13 remain today. ""...unpapered walls, the scrubbed floors hidden only by rugs and strips of carpeting, and the plain flat finish of the wood-work. Each chamber accommodates two brothers or two sisters, and is appointed with two beds, two rocking chairs, two wash stands, and a wood stove with abundance of rugs.there were few tokens of personal taste in the arrangements of the rooms."" Shirley Shakers built a profitable applesauce industry throughout the 19th century. They also ventured into broom-making, jelly-making, mop manufacturing, and herb preparation. However, similar to the Alfred Shakers, too many economic enterprises failed to sustain the village. The community dissolved in 1908. Remaining members moved to the Harvard Shaker Village to continue practicing their religious devotion and live out the rest of their lives.",https://www.nps.gov/places/shirley-shaker-village.htm
"The human eye has been called the most complex organ in our body. It's amazing that something so small can have so many working parts. But when you consider how difficult the task of providing vision really is, perhaps it's no wonder after all. The human eye is like a camera. Light comes in through the cornea, a clear cover that is like the glass of a camera's aperture. The pupil, an opening that opens and closes a little like a camera shutter, controls the amount of light coming in. Some carry fluids (such as tears and blood) to lubricate or nourish the eye. Others are muscles that allow the eye to move. Some parts protect the eye from injury (such as the lids and the epithelium of the cornea). And some are messengers, sending sensory information to the brain (such as the pain-sensing nerves in the cornea and the optic nerve behind the retina. As a conscious sense organ the eye allows vision. Rod and cone cells in the retina allow conscious light perception and vision including color differentiation and the perception of depth. The human eye can distinguish about 16 million colors. Human eye is divided in two main part front part is called cornea and back part is called sclera attached with cornea. Inner side is aqueous humor. Lens and muscles are present. Human eye vision is determined by brain area near occipital lobe.

"Compact Camping Concepts’s No Weld Trailer Rack Brackets now allow folks with basic DIY skills and tools to build sturdy, long-lasting trailer racks. The brackets help you to make solid corner connections with no welding required. Purchase a bracket set and source your 1.5” square tubing locally to keep cost down. Purchase a bracket set with precut 1.5” square tubing sections. Purchase a complete rack ready for painting and bolting together. To build a trailer rack: what you are basically doing is creating two hoops and connecting them together. The hoops can be side-to-side in the front and rear, or front-to-back on each side. You connect the hoops together to increase the overall rigidity of your rack. The primary bracket of the rack system is the corner bracket. With corner brackets, there are two types of joints. Where a tubing section intersects another. For applications where the racks will attach to a flat deck or pad, we have a base bracket. Rack uprights can also be bolted directly to the side of frames and trailer boxes. Begin by determining the shape and size of your rack. I do this by sketching planned rack. Then use the sketch to figure out the number of bracket needed and tube lengths. Once you have received your brackets, the first step is cutting your piece to size. This could be done with a hack saw, but that would take some time. A better way to cut your tubing is using a 4.5” angle grinder with a cutoff wheel attached. After you have your tubing cut to length, lay the piece out on the floor the way they go together. Then going one section at a time, position the brackets at the joint positions, square the joints up and mark the bracket holes. Then painting can be as simple as a quick scuff up with 220 sandpaper, a wipe down with something like xlyene to clean and a coat or two of enamel rattle can paint. Finally, assemble everything with 5/16” x 2 1/4″ bolt, load up whatever you plan to load on your rack and get out for some fun.",https://www.compactcampingconcepts.com/camping-trailer-no-weld-rack/
"Dental labs today face constant changes in technology and increasing overseas competition. CAD/CAM technology aims to reduce direct labor cost yet foreign labor remains cheaper. Finding and implementing practical tools of efficiency, accuracy and simplicity into our laboratories to stay competitive and cost effective can be especially tricky when investing in new technology or change. When it comes to model, die and articulation “cost effective, efficient and accurate” are the essence of Monotrac — offering more capability, options, accuracy and efficiency than any other model system out there. The integrated articulator, with pinless cone matrix model base, allows a single pour “cast-in-place” set-up that is simple and fast while eliminating labor intensive pinning and basing procedures. Monotrac dies are easily removed and reseat with solid stable precision. Even lower anteriors, the thinnest of dies, resist lateral sway. Other key features of the Monotrac are the Flex Arm Hinge allowing natural excursive equilibration. The Plug-in adjustable vertical stops are easy to place and eliminate the need for a metal articulator set up. The Monotrac V2 is full range capable for all model and die needs in the lab. One system covers it all from refractory to section implant models to full round house, it can do it. Because Monotrac does not require stone basing, cross arch and linear secondary base expansion issues are non existent. This tray provides the most accurate double bite impression attainable. The Occlu-Tray is a reusable stainless steel rigid tray that will not torque or flex thereby eliminating distorted impressions. Mesh is now eliminated with the Occlu-Tray rim design allowing maximum intercuspation or natural centric occlusion to be precisely replicated into the impression. A Monotrac “cast-in-place” set up ensures this accuracy is also replicated to the articulated model. Minimize remake headaches and reduce chair time with precision fitting restorations. Designed for ultimate efficiency and to complete all model processing procedures in one location. The Monotrac Diamond Die Cutter and Processing Station features an adjustable height motorized diamond blade for quick, accurate die sectioning. The blue tabletop flips up instantly so it then can be used lathe-style for side cutting of models. The convenient vacuum port located at the front of the station incorporates a built-in inverted air blaster that instantly removes dust and debris from the model die matrix cone holes. A removable magnetic dust shield with magnifier enhances efficiency and vision during model flash clean up and for bulk trimming dies. The station comes with fittings and adapters for hook up to laboratory vacuum and air pressure.",https://www.monotrac.com/product-info

"Stemming from a San Diego dog bite injury case that occurred on June 18, 2011, Alba Corenlio and Carla Cornelio, owners of the pit bulls that mauled an elderly neighbor, are expected to stand trial for manslaughter, a felony charge of owning mischievous animals that caused a death and six misdemeanors relating to the attack. According to an article in the U-T San Diego, 75-year-old Emako Mendoza was viciously attacked by the two pit bulls when she went to the backyard of her home to get her morning newspaper. Mendoza lived next door to the Cornelios in Paradise Hills. The two pit bulls had gotten into her yard through a gap in the fence. After the attack, the two pit bulls and their three-week-old puppies were euthanized. The attack was so severe that Mendoza’s left arm and leg left had to be amputated. The vicious attack had also caused her to suffer a heart attack. Months of rehabilitation did not improve Mendoza’s condition. She died on December 24, 2011. The Cornelios will likely pose another seemingly plausible argument in their defense. They will likely argue that they should not be held legally responsible for Mendoza’s death because pit bulls are domesticated animals, and the rule is that owners of domesticated animals cannot be held liable for injuries caused by such animals. Assuming that the court considers a pit bull to be a domesticated animal, the Cornelios may be successful in their argument. However, as our Escondido dog bite lawyer is well aware of tort law, there is an important exception to this rule. If the owner of a domesticated animal has knowledge of the animal’s vicious propensities, then he or she will be liable for any injuries caused. Earlier hearings in this particular case have revealed that the Cornelios had knowledge that the dogs were dangerous because they had attacked a man walking his puppy on Christmas 2010. Thus, the Cornelios desperate hope of being released of any legal responsibility will likely be dismissed. As demonstrated by this particular incident, a seemingly simple case in actuality contains several strands of legal complexities. Therefore, it is important to have a Oceanside personal injury lawyer help protect the legal rights of those who have suffered injuries in any kind of accident.

"Bloodwise has been announced as the Official Charity of two brand new city-based marathons - the Stirling Scottish Marathon and Birmingham International Marathon – taking place on 21 May and 15 October 2017, respectively. Our running team, which includes faces from the world of TV such as Emmerdale's Tony Audenshaw (pictured), have been associated with the Great Run Series and their portfolio of runs - including the iconic Great North Run – for 30 years. Birmingham is central to our life-saving work, with £20million invested in 32 different blood cancer research projects and clinical drugs trials in the city. Funds raised from the Birmingham Marathon 2017 will be invested in the trials acceleration programme which has its hub in the city, speeding up access to new treatments and drugs for blood cancer patients. We also have a strong presence in Scotland, with over £6million currently invested in blood cancer research projects at Glasgow and Edinburgh Universities. Matt Lawley, Head of Sports Events at Bloodwise, says: “We are really excited to be the official charity of these two brand new events, particularly as much of the work we do in researching better treatments for blood cancer takes place in and around these cities. The partnership will help to raise funds to improve the lives of patients and increase awareness of the disease as the fifth most common cancer and third biggest cause of cancer deaths. Tony, who plays Bob Hope in TV soap Emmerdale, regularly takes part in marathons and half marathons for Bloodwise. He adds: “These events are a first for the Great Run series and what better incentive than to run for the series' official charity and help beat blood cancers at the same time as challenging yourself.""

"The U.S. Supreme Court Just handed down a 7-2 decision in favor of the baker in Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, saying that the baker had the First Amendment right to not bake and decorate a wedding cake for a gay couple as that violated his sincerely held religious beliefs. Most likely nothing. The decision is very narrowly tailored to where strongly held religious beliefs clash with other civil rights. The court was careful to note that the baker was willing to make a birthday cake for the gay couple, but not a wedding cake, as he felt that would violate his religious beliefs. They pointed out that no one would expect that a ""member of the clergy who objects to gay marriage on moral and religious grounds"" could be ""compelled to perform the ceremony without denial of his or her right to the free exercise of religion."" Yet, we wouldn't want to extend that protection to everyone and everything related to marriage. Could a chair rental company refuse to rent chairs to a wedding they disagreed with? Under this decision, no. The court relied on the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop's description that a cake is an artistic expression and therefore covered by the First Amendment. The result would have been different if the baker ""refused to sell any goods or any cakes for gay weddings."" The person refusing has sincerely held religious beliefs. If you, or one of your employees, has a strong religious belief that prohibits him or her from creating something for a customer, you're not required to do so. If it's an employee who has an objection, you would have to offer a reasonable accommodation to the employee to not participate in the speech-related activity. This court specifically said this case does not decide all other pending cases involving the conflict between religious views and gay marriage, and they will have to be further hammered out in the courts. In other words, neither side should consider this matter resolved. The big takeaway for business: You need to see both sides. That consideration was compromised, however, by the Commission's treatment of Philips' case, which showed elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs motivating his objection. As the record shows, some of the commissioners at the Commission's formal, public hearings endorsed the view that religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into the public sphere or commercial domain, disparaged Phillips' faith as despicable and characterized it as merely rhetorical, and compared his invocation of his sincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the Holocaust. No commissioners objected to the comments. Nor were they mentioned in the later state-court ruling or disavowed in the briefs filed here. The comments thus cast doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the Commission's adjudication of Phillips' case. In other words, the court didn't believe that the commission looked at the case fairly, and as such, they couldn't trust the outcome of the decision. While your business doesn't do public investigations, you will have to investigate employee complaints regarding sexual harassment, gender discrimination, and the like. If you come into it biased against one side and with your mind already made up, you're doing it wrong. If you can't conduct an impartial investigation to make a well-reasoned decision, hire someone from the outside.",https://www.inc.com/suzanne-lucas/supreme-court-your-bakery-doesnt-have-to-bake-a-gay-wedding-cake.html

"Professional pictures are sure to be special keepsakes. Thus, one of the things in my to-do-list whilst I am visiting my hometown, other than bringing Baby Naomi to a Baby Spa house, is to take family studio photos with Baby Naomi. The perk of this time's family studio photo shoot was to do the photo shoot together with my best friend, her baby girl and husband. From the moment my best friend and I confirmed the slot for this joint studio photo shoot, both of us were beyond excited and really looked forward to a super-duper fun photo session. Weeks later, the D-Day finally came and it was on the second day my husband, baby and I arrived to Indonesia. I was expecting really fun photo session that're full of giggles, laughter and lots of ""Aahhh!"" ""Ooooh!"" ""So cuteeee!"" But no, they didn't really happen. Truth is, my friend and I (together with our husbands) had to sweat ourselves so much in attempts to make our babies smile and we almost could not relax or catch up during the whole photo session. We've danced, clapped our hands, made silly faces, sung favorite kiddie songs, shaken lots of rattle toys - you name it, to make our babies showcase their smiling faces in this rare opportunity. My friend succeeded in making her baby smile many times and I failed. Moreover, it was equally not easy either to calm our fussy babies who, at many points, were not cooperative and in their best mood to smile and strike a pose, unlike their Moms. Anyway, I was really surprised to see the final results of the studio photos when the photographer presented them to me two days ago. They all look so good and Baby Naomi, albeit her stingy smile, looks adorable and amazingly cute in all shots. In short, I selected all the photos that the photographer wanted me to choose and ended purchasing three extra pictures because I could not bear not keeping the soft copies of Baby Naomi's first studio photos. After this experience, I still want to take more and more studio photos with Baby Naomi in the near future. Taking studio photos is so addictive, don't you agree? Our first proper family photo. Thanks for the headband, Aunt Astrid! My bestie, me and our babies. Make sure your baby is fed and has taken his or her nap before the photo session. Bring lots of toys to distract your baby's attention and entertain him or her during photo session. Don't hesitate to dress your baby in bright and solid color outfits for the picture day as they will photograph well. However, make sure that those outfits are comfortable for your baby to wear. Don't forget to bring the matching accessories too, if any. Bring outfits (for parents) that match the color of the baby's outfits. You won't regret somewhat matching wardrobe choices for the family photo session. If the photo shoot is taken in a completely new environment, give your baby a couple of days to adapt in the new place and get used to meeting new people before the photo shoot day. My mistake was to take Baby Naomi to a photo session a day after we landed to Indonesia. She was probably still tired from our long-distance overseas trip and was not used to be seen and talked by total strangers around her. As a result, she barely smiled and showed us her four pearly whites during the photo session. Don't forget to bring extra diapers, feed and so on in the diaper bag just like how we are out and about with baby as per usual. The rests are own collection. so nice pic for u blog.",http://www.mywanderingstory.com/2013/04/baby-naomis-first-studio-photos_20.html

"A little bit ago, Tyler vouched this month’s issue of The Collagist, which sports an excerpt of There Is No Year, a novel by Blake Butler. I’m going to go ahead and break ranks for a minute here to go ahead and tell you that you need to buy this book. It’s releasing on Harper Perrenial, which I know goes against the mission of Vouched to promote since it’s a big house, but I’m going to promote it anyway because if ever there was a champion for the possibility of small presses, it was Blake. I won’t go so far as to stock it on the table, though I’d love to, but a blog post I can do, and gladly. And also, I’m just excited to see a big house paying attention to a book like this, a book that grew out of the work Blake has already released on small presses like featherproof and Calamari, and I think that deserves a mention. So, get this book. Also available for Kindle. If you still need convincing, read the above linked excerpt. I’m convinced that will convince you. ← Happy How They Were Found Day!",https://vouchedbooks.com/2011/04/05/today-is-no-year-there-is-no-year/
"The recession has officially come to an end in France, Germany, and more generally in Europe. But for the economists this does not mean a return to economic growth. One might have thought that, with François Hollande, realism would get the upper hand, all the more so as the 0.5% growth mainly rests on 0.4% growth in household consumption … which is partly linked to bad weather, the lousy spring having made energy bills balloon. Growth without jobs or investment: France continued to destroy jobs – 27,800 in the same period, as against 8,300 in the preceding quarter. The government has not commented on that figure. According to Eric Heyer, an economist at the French institute for the economic situation, “lasting economic recovery can only come if there is investment. Today, there isn’t any.” Investment has indeed continued to fall, even though it is at a slower rate (a 0.5% drop in the second quarter, as against a 1% drop in the first quarter). The same persuasive efforts are being made in Germany. With 0.7% growth, that is, 0.1% more than expected, and five weeks before the parliamentary elections, the German minister of the economy jumped at the opportunity. “Germans have every reason to be optimistic as to the future,” said Philipp Rösler. “We must continue on the same path that, until now, has brought success: solid finances, competitive companies, and a policy that opens up margin for maneuver,” tax breaks, the pet subject of his liberal party (FDP). With all due respect to the minister and to German chancellor Angela Merkel, here again, the extent of the bounce back seems to be linked to unusual climate conditions and to the housing bubble, prices having rocketed by 10% since 2000 according to the minister of the economy. While the details of this growth will not be known before August 23, these springlike figures are partly to be explained by an adjustment effect, notably in the building trades, which had been sluggish for months due to a harsh winter. Moreover, the minister has not revised his 0.5% growth prediction for 2013 as a whole. Countries that remain in the red. According to Eurostat, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the 27 EU countries grew by 0.3% compared to the first quarter, a figure that is slightly better than the 0.2% growth expected by the economists. But four countries are mainly concerned by this recovery: France and Germany on the one hand, Finland and Portugal on the other. On the flip side, Italy, Spain, Greece and the Netherlands are still in recession. But this is enough for the European Commission’s propaganda: “A lasting recovery is now within reach, but only if we continue our response to the economic crisis on all fronts,” insisted the European commissioner on economic affairs, Olli Rehn, in his blog.",http://www.humaniteinenglish.com/spip.php?article2328

"For those who haven’t seen it before, Microsoft Surface is a sort of digital coffee table; it’s got a large, flat touch sensitive screen (kind of like an upsized and hard-to-move iPhone. SurfaceScapes puts an interactive map on the Surface, which you can interact with by moving around specially designed miniatures. All of the rules you need to run the game (e.g. movement, powers, etc.) are built into the game, and you can interact with your character through a handheld device (e.g. an iPod touch or smart phone). Putting aside snide comments about 4E finally realizing its video game roots, I think this is pretty darn cool. As a GM, I love the idea of using Campaign Cartographer to create rich, beautiful maps, complete with sound effects and event-triggered background music, but it’s hard to pull off in the real world (not impossible, just challenging). Something like SurfaceScapes could let you do all that, while simultaneously abstracting away all those crunchy RPG rules (as we already do every time we fire up Dragon Age, Fallout or Mass Effect). I think games like D&D (be it 3.x or 4.x) led themselves to this sort of digitization, and I could see the hobby moving in this direction someday. But (and you knew there had to be one) … there’s a real problem with cost. These Microsoft Surface units cost upwards of $12,500 (see Wikipedia for cost estimates) making them unrealistic for most people’s weekly game, and putting them out of reach of most hobby stories. I also wouldn’t really want this to replace my conventional game — I like using my imagination for all of this, regardless of how cumbersome the rules can be at times.

"When older adults experience a sudden change in their mental or behavioral health, those who care for them — from family and friends to referring physicians and social workers — can turn to Rockford Center’s Older Adult Behavioral Health Program for quality short-term stabilization services. Rockford Center’s Older Adult Behavioral Health Program is designed to help adults who are generally 65 years of age and older regain their mental health, by providing a therapeutic program tailored to meet each patient’s specific needs. The first step in determining if an older adult can benefit from receiving care through the Older Adult Behavioral Health Program is to call Rockford Center’s Assessment Referral Center (ARC) at 302-996-5480. ARC is staffed 24-hours a day, 7 days a week. Upon receiving a call, ARC’s professional assessment counselors will take information and consult with our nursing and medical staff to determine if the Older Adult Behavioral Health Program is the most suitable treatment option.. If so, the ARC counselor will schedule an assessment. If during the assessment it is determined that inpatient care is indicated, the ARC counselors will be responsive to that need and arrange for admission on a timely basis. Because the Older Adult Behavioral Health Program focuses on short-term stabilization, we do not accept patients who need skilled nursing care (require feeding tubes, IV’s, or catheters). Our primary goal is to assess each patient’s needs and make appropriate clinical recommendations. That is why our staff of experienced, highly-trained behavioral healthcare professionals, including psychiatrists, social workers, nurses and counselors conduct a comprehensive multi-disciplinary assessment. that determines the patient’s daily routine and therapeutic activities. The Older Adult Behavioral Health Program plan of care may include a variety of structured physical and creative group activities that help to control symptoms, orient and re-motivate the patient, encourage the highest level of independence possible, and enhance self-regard. Each day may include reminiscence and relaxation exercises, music and art therapies, as well as other leisure time activities. We schedule administration of medication, snacks, meals, and frequent hygiene breaks into each day. Our nursing staff is specially trained in providing geriatric care. They are experienced in providing assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADL), mobility, fall prevention, nourishment/hydration, and interventions used for making patients feel more comfortable and secure. We treat every patient with respect, dignity, and compassion. Caregiver support and education are integral to all treatment plans. The Older Adult Behavioral Health Program provides a welcoming, therapeutic, spacious, and safe environment which is located in a separate part of our Adult Inpatient Services area. Bedrooms and bathrooms are newly renovated and wheelchair accessible. Visitors are welcomed here on a flexible schedule that includes both afternoon and evening hours, and special arrangements can be made when needed. Clergy may visit at any time. To help ensure access to the high quality of care and treatment provided by the Older Adult Behavioral Health Program, we accept most insurance plans, including HMO’s, PPO’s, and other managed care plans. Also, we are Medicaid, Medicare, and Champus approved.",http://www.rockfordcenter.com/older-adult-services-65/

"Staff Sergeant Millard Dewitt Adams, 22, of Science Hill, Pulaski County, Kentucky was killed in combat with his unit, B Company, 1-149th Infantry on 10 December 1944 on Leyte Island in the Philippines. The 149th was taking part in operations to defeat a Japanese offensive to retake Buri airstrip. He was reportedly killed by an enemy sniper. Adams enlisted at Somerset, Kentucky on 8 November 1939, with Company B, 149th Infantry, Kentucky National Guard. He was living at Bethelridge, Casey County, Kentucky, at the time of enlistment and listed his civilian occupation as student. Adams was inducted into federal service with his unit on 6 January 1941. Adams cousin, Delmar Adams (P2, C1, L1), was also killed in this engagement while serving with B Company on 9 December 1944. Adams is buried in the Science Hill Cemetery, Science Hill, Pulaski County, Kentucky. While no definitive information has been found it is believed that the following members of the Kentucky National Guard perished during this engagement in addition to Adams: Edward Stewart Co A, 1-149th 7 December; Willie Alley Co C, 1-149th 8 December; Fred Henson Co C, 1-149th 8 December; Delmar Adams Co B, 1-149th 9 December and Warren Stambaugh HQ Co, 2-149th 10 December.",https://guardmemorial.com/html/adams_millard_d_.html
"I think in glacial terms. As a longtime student of history, I tend to take a very long view of ""current"" events, and I have a strong belief in the resilience of the human spirit. I love this country, even with all its problems, and as Winston Churchill once said, ""It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried."" Perhaps that is true...the checks and balances DO seem to work for us, over time, if a bit frighteningly unbalanced at any given moment. Then this image intruded itself into my mind, and would NOT go away. An argument with an old old friend forced my hand, at least internally, and I knew I had to paint it...the pivotal moment when the second plane hit the Twin Towers, and what has happened to us as a country since. Like almost everyone, I was deeply affected by that event, for a variety of reasons. It took a long time not to react to every plane that flew over, not to dread the news for fear of what might have happened next, not to fear for my friends and loved ones who were in harm's way. We lost a great deal of innocence and our sense of safety that day, along with thousands of innocent lives. The courage we saw in those who helped the survivors, and the caring between those people themselves was awe-inspiring. It affected us, and the world--and continues to affect us, for good or ill. At first we DID pull together, as a people--here and abroad. What has happened since is increasingly painful. My painting is about that matrix. So many decisions to be made, when tackling a subject like this...what size, what palette, what format, and more importantly, how much to spell out, what to leave ambiguous? It has not been a fun painting, or a relaxing one, but one I needed to do. At first I thought I would not be able to bear to LOOK at it, and wondered how I could do a painting I'd have to hide from myself. But I find looking at it is healing, for me. And yes, this is a self portrait in many senses of the word...it is about my feelings, my experience, my feeling caught in the middle, my despair...and I used myself as a model, in the center.",https://www.ebsqart.com/Artist/Cathy-Kate-Johnson/1494/Exhibit-Entries/Stop/99094/

"Canterbury School is celebrating National Arts in Education Week, Sept. 9 – 15! The US House of Representatives designated the second week in September as National Arts in Education Week in 2010, with the intent of showcasing the transformative power of the arts. They explained that the arts ""equip students with a creative, competitive edge"" and that ""attracting and retaining the best teachers is vital and can be achieved by ensuring that schools embrace the arts, becoming havens for creativity and innovation"" Students from the Early Childhood, Lower School, Middle School and High School divisions will have artwork on display at the Arts United Center, which happily welcomes community members throughout the day. Early Childhood students will experience a special classical music concert in Lily's Garden. Our very own Mr. and Mrs. Tan will perform with members from the Fort Wayne Philharmonic. High School students will rehearse ""Seussical: The Musical"" in preparation for their performances on Oct. 26 and 27, which are both open to the public. The Canterbury School Fine Arts Department has experience continued growth since 1977, when the school's founders recognized the arts as an essential part of a complete education. They believed in maximizing learning in and through the arts and set out to develop students with a lifelong appreciation for drama, visual art and music. Over time, the Fine Arts Department has expanded from those three original offerings to also include dance, music technology, music theory and film. Collectively, these classes provide even greater opportunities for self-expression, cross-cultural understanding, confidence, creativity and discipline. Thanks to the vision of these founders and support from current administration, our students have an extremely arts rich experience. Each week, our students study fine arts. Middle School students take dance, dramatic oratory, drama, visual art and music, and they can choose to pursue electives like speech, film, 3D art, graphic design, band, chess, choir and orchestra. High School students can choose among choir, band, orchestra, visual art, theatre, music technology, film, music theory and speech.

"SAN DIEGO – After years of stagnant demand for widebody freighter conversions, 2016 saw the market suddenly bounce back. Last year, fourteen 767 P-to-F conversions were added to the global widebody freighter fleet (eleven 767-300BDSFs and three 767-300BCFs), and a similar number will be put into service in 2017. However, according to speakers on an appraiser’s panel at last week’s ISTAT Americas conference, this phenomenon is broadly viewed as a one-time event, supporting the ramp-up of Amazon’s Prime Air network, rather than the beginning of a widebody conversion renaissance. “We are not going to see a lot of widebody conversions after Amazon,” said Douglas Kelly, SVP asset valuation at AVITAS Inc., as many of the carriers who previously would have found widebody conversions appealing, have disappeared. Since the 2008 recession, industry consolidation has significantly reduced the number of widebody freighter operators, from 95 in 2012, to just 75 in 2016. This, coupled with the proliferation of cargo-friendly widebody passenger aircraft like the 777-300ER, has reduced demand growth for freighters. Take last year for example, underlying air freight market growth was 3.8%, yet the global widebody freighter fleet expanded by less than 1%. This is not to say that freighters no longer have a place – they certainly do. But most of the larger cargo carriers that remain in the market have better access to capital, and can achieve high utilization rates on long-haul intercontinental routes. Such utilization says Kelly, enables these carriers to justify the higher acquisition costs of new-build widebody freighters. FedEx and UPS for example, both operate large fleets of freighter-converted widebodies, but, in recent orders, have opted instead for new-build freighters. Domestic routes do not see nearly the utilization, and thus freighter-converted 767s have found their sweet spot on routes where express operators can fill the cube. ATSG’s subsidiary airlines have long operated freighter-converted 767s for DHL within the United States in support of DHL’s international network. And now Amazon has placed its bet on converted 767s. As a result, nearly all of the redelivered 767 conversions in 2016 went into service for Amazon. Still, there are hundreds of widebody freighters that will need to be replaced in the future (even if not on a 1:1 ratio), and a significant number of ageing widebody passenger aircraft. When asked if freighter conversion programs would emerge for airframes like the 777 as they have in the past for the 747 and A300, panelists were bearish, at least for the near-term. Operational comparisons with 777 new-build freighters aside, Stuart Rubin, Principal at ICF doubted the economic feasibility of a 777 conversions due to high feedstock acquisition costs. Lindsey Webster, director asset valuations, Morten Beyer & Agnew, agreed that, in the short term, the number of parked widebody freighters on the secondary market meant that 777-200LR conversions were unlikely. In a few years, when an increasing number of 777-300ERs begin to reach retirement age, the market could potentially support conversion, but, in the near-term, panelists did not expect much beyond Prime Air’s 767 fleet build-up. Of course, Amazon could choose to add larger freighters once its new air hub in Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky is operational, and UPS could replace its MD-11Fs with conversions rather than new-build freighters, but it is difficult to identify any other potential operators of freighter-converted widebodies. Turning to China, the crystal ball becomes a bit murkier when attempting to forecast freighter demand. Tightly controlled airspace and restricted landing slots, paired with a pilot shortage, could force China’s burgeoning express market to favor larger widebodies. SF Express will take delivery of its fifth 767F this year, and is eager to continue growing. SF’s next steps will shed more light onto the viability of the 767F for domestic express service in China, but for now, the region could still become another hotspot for medium widebody freighters.",https://cargofacts.com/widebodies-less-likely-to-see-second-life-as-freighters/
"Nottingham Forest left back Danny Fox has told the club’s official matchday magazine The Reds will be going all out to maintain their excellent City Ground form between now and the end of the season.

"People with bad credit think that they do not qualify for good credit offers. It may be possible that they may have tried to get credit from a few lenders but when they failed to get them. Secured cards are quite suited for people with bad credit. For secured card, one has to submit a security deposit, which guarantees you a line of credit for that amount. For instance, if you require a $700 line of credit, you have to deposit $7000 with the issuer, which immunizes your account. Since there is no much risk here for the card issues, there is more chance of the approving applications for people with bad credit or no credit. You can use this secured card to make transactions, build credit like every other cardholder. This is in fact, a good opportunity for people to use the secured card wisely, restore and build credit. When you close the account, the security deposit is refunded sometimes with interest. 1. Capital One Secure MasterCard – The card has a low annual fee of $29 and can help people with bad credit come up in a big manner. Though most secured cards offer spending limit equivalent to the amount you deposit, this card is a hybrid between a regular credit card and secured card. This is preferred as one of the best choices for people to get back into the traditional system of credit. You have to put $49 and can get a credit line of $200. By depositing money like $200, you can actually increase the credit line to $3000. Capital One also ensures that one you have been able to improve your credit score, you will get preference to avail of one of its unsecured credit cards. 2.Wells Fargo Secured Visa – You can apply for this card only if you have been out of bankruptcy for one year and there are no liens unsettled against you. Your security deposit between $300 and $10,000 can set the credit limit. There is a $35 annual fee. 3.Orchard Bank Classic Card – HSBC’s subsidiary Orchard Bank says that all applicants who give a security deposit will be approved irrespective of credit score being dismal or if you have declared bankruptcy. There is a $200 minimum security deposit, with no annual fee for the first year and then $35 annual fee from the second year. 4.U.S. Bank Secured VISA – This bank diverts your security deposit into an interest-savings account with a $35 annual fee. Getting small installment loans like an auto loan or a small personal loan (best from a credit union, or bank) to the tune of $1000 which you can pay back on time, can help rebuild your credit. Though you will have to cough up a higher interest rate, the fact that you have an active installment account on your credit report can boost your score. Also don’t close your credit account because they may hurt your score. Most importantly, pay your bill on time, all the time because skipped payments can only ruin all the good work you have done.",https://balancetransferpromotions.net/2012/10/

"Some of the tears he whittles into fine points. Those are good for gouging out his eyes. Others he distills. At night, blind and drunk, he pretends he can’t feel a thing. That's one of those exceptional fusions of idea and image that take your breath away. I will go on from here pretending that I thought it up! ""At night, blind and drunk,"" indeed. Fabulous! Wow! This one is a painfully powerful twist. “Some of the tears he whittles into fine points.” Amazing imagery. Powerful imagery, Mr. Lucky. Inspiring. Wowzers! That was so powerful! Thank you for sharing your work with us! What draws me in most in this very powerful piece is the way the masculine is juxtaposed with the feminine. We first see emotion categorized by material production, violent physical action, war on oneself, an attempt to deny emotion–all things which tend to be associated with the masculine or animus. Then in the haiku, the feminine or anima begins to emerge, first in the form of a new moon, then the womblike void, then the all-powerful symbol of the cauldron itself. These seem to be separate at first glance. But then images begin to connect with one another–the chiseled slivers of tears with the sliver of moon, the blindness with the black, the distillation with the cauldron–until one feels a wholeness beginning to emerge from the brokenness. I love the way the title, which harkens to these soul processes we all must go through, both ties prose and haiku together and expands the piece beyond the sum of those parts. I agree with Wow! And the description of grief as a cauldron . . .",https://tinywords.com/2018/12/07/28616/comment-page-1/

Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models. 2018-12-06While Adobe products are using Node.js and I give up my resistance, but they are often forcibly implementing software that seems to bash out customers' internal information can be discharged to an external network environment.

"Some time in eighth grade, my sister and I decided we would get matching heart tattoos on the left corner of our left wrists. I’m not sure when we decided this; there was never a definitive moment. However, I suspect it developed when we, and the rest our friends, were really into doodling all over our hands and arms. I always drew three stars on my left wrist — a classic middle-school move — but I knew the permanent ink must be a heart. My sister and I are twins born on Valentine’s Day. It had to be honored. Come mid-May our senior year of high school, we hopped into my mom’s minivan with our best friend and headed to a tattoo parlor on a Tuesday night. Clad in my American Red Cross sweatshirt and black yoga sweats, I walked into the tattoo and piercing place where my sister had gotten her belly button pierced just three years earlier. But we had to leave. My sister and I didn’t have driver’s licenses at the time, and forgot to bring our birth certificates. It didn’t help that I had a young face either (and wet hair). Despite their condescension, the fact that they required ID was a good sign in retrospect. They were only following the rules. We drove home and picked up our birth certificates. Then we headed to the other side of town to the tattoo parlor where my mom got her tattoo over a decade ago (Also a heart! But different.). Because the tattoos were small and simple, the process was quick. I let my sister go first, as she is the older twin. She made some faces indicative of a little pain, but it really didn’t hurt her at all. And the same went for me. When the needle buzzed away at my skin, the area would go numb until the tattoo artist lifted it up again. After cleanup, payment and care instructions, we walked out of the tattoo parlor, happy with our first ink. The most basic principle of a tattoo is that it is permanent.

"WASHINGTON, D.C. – The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has approved a new federal standard intended to improve the safety of all high chairs, including those intended for both home and restaurant use. The new federal safety standard incorporates the most recent voluntary standard developed by ASTM International (ASTM F404-18, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for High Chairs), with no modifications. The voluntary standard includes requirements for rearward stability and warning labels and requires that high chairs have a passive crotch restraint and a three-point restraint system. Between January 2011 and September 2017, CPSC received a total of 1,842 incident reports related to high chairs, including 271 injuries. From 2015 through 2016, there were an estimated 18,500 high chair-related injuries treated in U.S. hospital emergency departments, according to CPSC’s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). Most of the incidents were due to falls when a child attempted to climb into or out of the high chair; when the chair tipped over as a child pushed back or rocked back and forth while seated in the high chair; or when a component (such as the restraint, tray, or lock) of the high chair failed. The effective date for the new mandatory high chair standard is 12 months after the final rule is published in the Federal Register and applies to products manufactured or imported on or after that date. The Commission is required by the Danny Keysar Child Product Safety Notification Act, Section 104(b) of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA), to issue consumer product safety standards for durable infant or toddler products. The Commission has approved new federal safety standards for several durable infant or toddler products, including full-size cribs, non-full-size cribs, play yards, baby walkers, baby bath seats, children’s portable bed rails, strollers, toddler beds, infant swings, handheld infant carriers, soft infant carriers, framed infant carriers, bassinets, cradles, portable hook-on chairs, infant sling carriers and infant bouncer seats.

"When you have a new multi use games area installed in surrounding areas, it is vital that you consider appropriate MUGA maintenance in Anderton CW9 6 to keep it in top condition for as long as possible. Each surface type can have different processes carried out which will help maintain the performance qualities and keep the sports area safe for use. Our sport surfacing company specialise in a range of cleaning, repair and general cleaning technniques https://www.muga.org.uk/cheshire/anderton/ Please contact our team today to find out more about what we can do and the costs for each cleaning method we offer. There are two main types of sport servicing services which we provide for sports surfacing facilities in the UK – Proactive and reactive servicing. Reactive repair maintenance in Anderton CW9 6 takes place to repair damage which has already been done to the surface, this could have occurred as a result of overuse, vandalism or lack of an appropriate proactive care programme. Examples of reactive servicing can include seam and joint repairs, repainting and reline marking, as well as top up and rejuvenation of infill. Rejuvenating sand and rubber infill for synthetic grass MUGAs involves extracting the contaminated infill layer and replacing it with a new clean layer which will improve the performance qualities and make the surface more durable.

MUGA maintenance costs will depend on a variety of different factors. The first aspect which will affect the servicing costs in Anderton CW9 6 and surrounding areas, is the area size of the facility. Obviously if the area is larger, the cost to clean the court or pitch will be more.

"Between 1997 and 2002, as the number of farms declined in Massachusetts, so did the total land in agriculture. The total amount of land in farms decreased from 577,637 acres in 1997 to 518,570 acres in 2002. The average farm size in Massachusetts declined steadily from over 130 acres per farm in 1974 to 79 acres in 1997 (Figure 3.2). With the exit of many smaller farms between 1997 and 2002, the average farm size increased to 85 acres in 2002. The total amount of land in farms further decreased to 517,879 acres in 2007, a very small 0.13 percent decline when compared to 2002. However, the 2012 Census shows a modest increase in the total amount of land in farms, with a 1.1 percent increase to 523,517 acres. The increase in the number of farms and the increase in farm size seem to have occurred proportionally to one another; the average size of farm also remained at around 67 acres between 2007 and 2012. In terms of farm numbers, the 2012 top three types of farming in Massachusetts are: horses and other equine production; hay farming; and greenhouse, nursery, and floriculture. However, which types of farming hold the greatest amounts of farmland? Open farmland is an important feature of the Massachusetts landscape. Hay farming is not only the second most common type of farming, but it holds the greatest amount of farmland with 116,980 acres, about 22 percent of the Commonwealth's farmland. Hay farms tend to be large by Massachusetts standards, with an average of about 107 acres per farm compared to the average Massachusetts farm, which is 67 acres in size. Fruit, tree nut and berry farms check in at number two, accounting for just over 80,568 acres of Massachusetts' farmland, 15.4 percent of the Commonwealth's total. Fruit and tree nut farms also tend to be relatively large by Massachusetts standards, there are about 103 acres per farm on average. When combined, these two types of farming represent about 38 percent of the state's farmland. Dairy farming in Massachusetts accounts for more than 50,000 acres of farmland, about 9.6 percent of the total. Dairy farms are the Commonwealth's largest farms on average; each dairy farm is nearly 342 acres in size. Hay farming and dairy farming are related as hay farms provide forage for dairy farms as well as the horse farms in the state. Thus, the tenuous state of dairy farming in the Commonwealth has implications for the importance of farmland and open space preservation in Massachusetts. A number of farm types (sheep and goats; greenhouse, nursery and floriculture; beef cattle; horse and equine; other crop farming; and vegetable and melon farming) each represent between 25,000 and 43,000 acres of farmland. Each of these represents between 4.6 and 8.1 percent of the Commonwealth's total farmland. Horse and equine production, despite being one of the most numerous farm types, represents about 7.8 percent of the Commonwealth's total farmland with around 41,000 acres of Massachusetts farmland.",http://ag.umass.edu/resources/massachusetts-agricultural-data/acres-land-in-farms

"The United States is designating as a foreign terrorist organization the military force charged with zealously guarding and advancing the principles of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday that the designation against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — part of what he said is a “maximum pressure campaign” against Tehran — would go into effect in one week. The IRGC includes the domestic-centered Basij militia, which has violently suppressed peaceful protests against the regime, and the Quds Force, which concentrates on operations abroad. “This is the first time that the United States has designated a part of another government as an FTO. We’re doing it because the Iranian regime’s use of terrorism as a tool of statecraft makes it fundamentally different from any other government. This historic step will deprive the world’s leading state sponsor of terror the financial means to spread misery and death around the world,” Pompeo said at the State Department. “The blood of the 603 American soldiers the Iranian regime has found to have killed in Iraq is on his hands and on the hands of the IRGC more broadly,” he said. “A(nother) misguided election-eve gift to Netanyahu. A(nother) dangerous U.S. misadventure in the region,” Zarif added on Monday. Pompeo dismissed Zarif’s reaction. “We have made clear both publicly and privately that an attack on the United States of America is something that they ought to think more than twice about,” he told reporters.",https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/counterterrorism/none-of-us-should-be-fooled-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-designated-a-terrorist-organization/

"As social media continues to explode as a marketing tool, limited-service restaurants will likely face even more decisions about how to spend their time and dollars in an effort to use special online deals to grab the attention and loyalty of customers. Whether it’s the use of Facebook, Twitter, or other tools to drive fans to the restaurant or daily deal couponing via Groupon and LivingSocial, operators are continuing to see their social media options grow. Back in 2004 I was the CIO for a nationwide automobile recycling company called Greenleaf (now LKQ) which would purchase cars with salvage titles at auto auctions, dismantle the cars and sell the parts. As you can imagine, the cars that we wanted to purchase were the ones with the largest number of usable, non damaged, parts that were in the greatest demand. We had written an application that would scour our current inventory and identify parts that we deemed that we needed for each vehicle at auction and place a value on said vehicle based on what we thought we could sell the parts for minus transport and other overhead costs. At the time, the existing technology was to use a ruggedized laptop where we entered in the usable parts for each vehicle at auction during the preview period and then would “sync” them at the end of the day to get the price we were willing to pay the next day at the auction. These notebook PCs were bulky and heavy and often suffered from poor battery life, so it was not always convenient for buyers to drag them around to the auctions. As a result, auction preview information – such as year, make, model and condition of the vehicles for sale – being gathered by buyers wasn’t always captured electronically. Often times, the “buyers” as we called them would cowboy up and place a value on the car “based on their years of buying experience”. Well as you can imagine, that resulted in many bad buys for Greenleaf where we could not sell the parts for what we expected to, or they sat around in inventory for a very long time. In order to find a solution to this problem, we spec’d out a wireless solution that would make it easier for the buyers to access the purchasing algorithm directly and in real-time via wireless PDAs (personal digital assistants) after looking at various tablet PC’s of that time. Evaluating the mobile devices and carriers was a huge task since in 2004 wireless broadband was not very prevalent. Each carrier that we used was different based on their coverage for that part of the country. Additionally, different types of PDAs were involved, based on what that carrier supported. To ensure the application was device independent, we used the Microsoft Mobile Internet Toolkit, which defines the framework and the user interface for a mobile Web application so that it will be compatible with any mobile device. The biggest challenge to overcome, however, was coping with the PDA screen size, which is much smaller than on the notebook PCs the buyers had previously been using. In order not to degrade the user experience, some unique interface design effort was required to collapse the presentation screen size and re-map the information onto the smaller PDA screen – while ensuring that the most relevant data was readily available to the buyers. Even though the application functionality was the same as before, many of the buyers had never used handheld devices, and the smaller screens and stylus took some getting used to. Additionally, these devices were not the best performers in the direct sunlight of the car lots. Why do I tell you all this? Because I almost look back daily since the advent of the iPad (and subsequently Android tablets) and think about how the iPhone/iPad was a revolution. The iPhone was a phone like no other when it came out and the iPad singlehandedly rescued an industry (tablet PCs) that had all but died. If today we could have given the buyers access to the purchasing algorithm via an app written for an iOS or Android tablet using 3G or 4G…man oh man! With today’s tablets perfect size, perfect weight and perfect thickness on a screen as sharp and usable in sunlight as say a Super AMOLED screen we would have overcome all of the challenges I mentioned above and had virtually no issues with our buyers. How about you, how are you taking advantage of mobile apps and tablet technology today to solve challenges in the Enterprise?",https://scottspiek.wordpress.com/2011/06/

"I really never had kissed a girl until I was 18. I put so much pressure on myself, that It could not happen, because of the Law of Attraction, (Back then I did not know about LOA, but I used to read Buddhist books). So once there was a summer festival in my little hometown. I made so much pressure on myself again, but I did not dare to speak to a girl, if I would, it never would have worked out, because of my Insecurities. The suffering was so unbearable, that suddenly I changed my mind and said to myself: ""Ok, I see I cannot force anything, I still love you. And if you stay without a girl for the rest of your life, that’s fine, I LOVE YOU."" Really the universe provides you with everything if you just GET OUT THE WAY!

"Athlete's food is a fungal infection that tends to be found between the toes. It is highly contagious and spreads rapidly in warm and damp places such as swimming pool and gym dressing rooms. Symptoms include inflammation, itchiness, cracked skin, scaling and blisters. Why does it flare up? Since the fungus thrives in a warm, moist environment - we want to change that environment. This can be done by using a hair dryer! After a shower, dry your feet well by patting the areas (not rubbing) especially between the toes. Then take the hair dryer, and on medium heat dry the area of the feet and the areas between the toes, and also dry the tops and bottoms of the toes. After drying thoroughly, spread some 100% pure virgin coconut oil (can find this in the oil section at the health food store) on the infected area of your feet. While you are at it, massage some of the oil on all of your feet and give yourself a quick Reflexology session by pressing and rubbing all the areas of your feet. Note: at room temperature the oil is in a solid form, so if it is cold you may need a spoon to scoop it out. If you do this every day - you may even forget that you used to have intense itching! Please let me know if it works for you. Oran Aviv, a senior Reflexologist since 1995, has been helping adults and children stay healthy for over 17 years.

"1. What is the transport protocol you use to call a Web service? SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is the preferred protocol. 2. True or False: A Web service can only be written in .NET? 3. What does WSDL stand for? 4. Where on the Internet would you look for Web services? 5. True or False: To test a Web service you must create a Windows application or Web application to consume this service? False, the web service comes with a test page and it provides HTTP-GET method to test. ViewState allows the state of objects (serializable) to be stored in a hidden field on the page. ViewState is transported to the client and back to the server, and is not stored on the server or any other external source. ViewState is used the retain the state of server-side objects between postabacks. 2. What is the lifespan for items stored in ViewState? 3. What does the “EnableViewState” property do? Why would I want it on or off? It allows the page to save the users input on a form across postbacks. It saves the server-side values for a given control into ViewState, which is stored as a hidden value on the page before sending the page to the clients browser. When the page is posted back to the server the server control is recreated with the state stored in viewstate. 4. What are the different types of Session state management options available with ASP.NET? ASP.NET provides In-Process and Out-of-Process state management. In-Process stores the session in memory on the web server. This requires the a “sticky-server” (or no load-balancing) so that the user is always reconnected to the same web server. Out-of-Process Session state management stores data in an external data source. The external data source may be either a SQL Server or a State Server service. Out-of-Process state management requires that all objects stored in session are serializable. How to create a package for web application with components that shared with other applications? Create a setup project which produces a .msi file. 2. Add AssemblyKeyFileAttribute to the assembly file and set it to the full name and path of the key file generated in step 1. The setup program detects a strong named assembly and installs it into GAC on the client machine. what is .net frame work? .Net facilitates integration of code written for desktop applications with code written for web applications. It also facilitates creation of assemblies from code files written in different .net languages. It provides a common type system (CTS) for bringing data types of all languages on a common platform. Simple answer to this is as follows Authentication is process of finding whether the user is valid.Example username and password u enter in mail page.That process is authentication Authorization is the process of holding rights for particular task.Example: Usually admin have right to install software in companies and others are not granted this right. What is difference between Authentication and Authorization? Assemblies are single deployable unit which consist of classes structures and interface.they consist of metadata which desrcibes assembly version ,name ,type etc. They are known as logical DLL’s . panel are scrollable and in panels captions can not be displayed. Asp is not compiled that is interperated where as ASP.net is compiled. I found that there are numerous posts for Assemblies but none for giving out the difference between Panel and a Group Box. Although a Panel as well as the groupbox are almost the same there are minute differences. In group box you can enter text while you cant do that in Panel. In Panel you have got a built in support for scrollbars which is not available in case of group box. What is the difference between excute query and excute nonquery.?

"Home>Supplements>Home Ownership>Homebuying: Move-In Ready or Fixer-Upper? What if you’re buying a house for the first time, but can’t decide if it should be a brand-new (turn-key) house or a charming one with good bones that needs a lot of work? Before you decide which kind of house you want, it’s always best to do your research, which will include the pros and cons of turn-key and fixer-upper properties. Also, don’t forget about property taxes, because depending on where you choose to buy a home, the selection can have a significant impact on the cost to remodel compared to the cost of purchasing a newly-constructed home. Consider that the cost of purchasing a brand-new home can run thousands of dollars more than an older home just in need of some tender, loving care. Overall, whether you move into turn-key home or the worst one on the block, it’s important to recognize which project provides the best fit for the buyer and their budget, and their expectations of the home. • Lastly, because both fixer-uppers and move-in ready homes have their own unique benefits and challenges, it will ultimately be left up to the homebuyer to go with the choice that best aligns with their budget, needs, and long-term goals for their new home.",https://washingtoninformer.com/homebuying-move-in-ready-or-fixer-upper/

"The maximum thermal performance or R-value of insulation is very dependent on proper installation. Homeowners can install some types of insulation -- notably blankets and materials that can be poured in place. Other types require professional installation. To evaluate blanket installation, you can measure batt thickness and check for gaps between batts as well as between batts and framing. In addition, inspect insulation for a tight fit around building components that penetrate the insulation, such as electrical boxes. To evaluate sprayed or blown-in types of insulation, measure the depth of the insulation and check for gaps in coverage. We take that nasty looking attic and crawl space, clean it, remove & install insulation, get rid of pests & rodents which leaves you with cleaner air and peace of mind. (Learn More). Radiant barriers are installed in homes -- usually in attics -- primarily to reduce summer heat gain and reduce cooling costs. The materials reflect radiation, and reduce the flow of heat. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning is the technology of indoor and vehicular environmental comfort. Its goal is to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality. Really had a good experience with Attic Bros from start to finish. The estimator came out to our home after contacting him, provided a clear and very reasonable quote for insulation and a radiant barrier and also improved the air flow in the attic. The estimator did a fantastic job at our home with radiant barrier, attic fans, attic entry tent zipper cover, and increasing the insulation height in our attic. Attic Bros was nearly $345 lower cost than the first estimate we got. Fast, Easy and professional estimates!",https://www.atticbros.com/residential/

"The concept of enjoying a leisurely meal in an establishment specifically devoted to preparing and serving food and ordering off of a menu is one that would have been quite foreign to our ancestors. In Europe, prior to the mid 18th century and even into the nineteenth century, dining outside of the home was regarded with great suspicion as the quality of food and the establishments in which one could eat were not held in high esteem. Dining outside of the home would typically only occur when a person was traveling and had no access to their own kitchen. The wealthy who traveled were more apt to have servants who carried quality foodstuffs and prepared it for them, or to stay in the homes of friends rather than eat at such establishments. There were indeed taverns or inns that provided accommodation and where food was served along with alcohol, but it was not always food of the highest quality, and the patrons of such establishments (thought to be drunkards and thieves) were looked upon with some trepidation as well. The concept of having a number of dishes to choose from that we are familiar with today was not an option at such eating establishments; patrons sat at one large table at an appointed hour and the eating was family style (the earliest definition of table d’hôte) and would consist of whatever the owner cared to prepare. In many cases, these dishes had the potential to be leftovers and scraps of the most foul quality imaginable. It was much the same in America. Taverns and boarding houses in the seventeenth and eighteenth century would have served primarily travelers, as there would have been little reason (or opportunity) for most Colonial Americans to eat outside of the home. And the food in such places, as in Europe, had little to recommend it.",http://digital.library.unlv.edu/index.php/collections/menus/history-restaurant-menus

"Articles Review - Journal of Psychosomatic Research - Articles on Primal Therapy by Arthur Janov, Ph.D. and E. Michael Holden, M.D. These two articles are transcripted from a presentation made by Drs. Janov and Holden in England. Accompanying the lectures were many charts and photographs. The lectures were made after the publication of Janov's Primal Man - The New Consciousness and are an excellent synopsis of their book. Janov explained that all of us we born with giant NEEDS and when these critical needs are not met we become in a state of PAIN. The automatic mechanism of repression then shuts off perception of the pain as well as the original need. This state of being is experienced as TENSION and NEUROSIS is thus developed. A faulty neurosis can result in a PSYCHOSIS. Dr. Janov mentioned that new-born babies have an unmistakable cry and that the cry is heard during primals of patients reliving their births. The cry cannot be duplicated even by a patient who has made the cry previously. He emphasized the necessity of dealing directly with the actual source of neurosis and psychosomatic disease which are permanently encoded in the brain. Techniques which do not involve the actual access to these stored memories and pain, he said, are merely palliative and do not cure the problem. He ended his discussion by emphasizing that the methodical approach to accessing trauma is best and believes that going directly to birth feelings right away can be dangerous since ""the patient is flooded with pain instead of integrating small pains at a time over many, many months."" In the Chapter entitled Primal Psychophysiology Neurologist E. Michael Holden, writes that "". . . psychosomatic illnesses are the direct result of unintegrated pain from childhood."" When the presentation was given he was the medical director of the Primal Institute. In the second part of his presentation, Dr. Holden summarizes five interesting case studies illustrating how psychosomatic diseases have their origin in our earlier life. The first case he discusses was of a man who had a heart attack and afterwards suffered from angina after exercise. A treadmill test (with EKG) resulted in severe shortness of breath and left arm heaviness. After primal therapy he no longer had these symptoms except when he puts off having a primal feeling. A repetition of the treadmill test showed that his cardiac reserve had increased. The second case study was of a male primal patient who had episodes of unexplained vomiting as an infant. During his early teen years he developed mucous colitis, which symptom continued to be triggered under severe emotional stress. After primal therapy he was able to discontinue all medications and developed the colitis only when he needed to primal. In primals he was able to hook up the second line cause of his disease to a fear of his father who used to beat him unmercifully. Another case study dealt with an asthmatic man who developed his symptoms at age two. He noticed in therapy that the primal was able to eliminate the asthma even more quickly than the medication he was taking. When he has an attack of asthma he was able to almost instanteously resolve the attack by primalling. The fourth case was of a man who suffered from migraine headaches with nausea. When the patient allowed himself to relive his birth feelings in primals the migraine headaches resolved themselves between ten and fifteen minutes. The number of migraine headaches he had after therapy were greatly reduced and when he has an attack he is able to resolve it quickly. The last case discussed involved a man with severe high blood pressure. Like the other case studies he was able to reduce his symptom by primalling. Interestingly, he noticed that when he becomes depressed and is able to cry his blood pressure is normal. When the depression lifts he is no longer aware of the need to primal but his hypertension had become higher. Dr. Holden writes: ""Here we see an exchange between a symptom existing when awareness of suffering is slight, and the absence of the symptom when suffering and reactivity to Pain are great."" In discussing the general implications and principles illustrated, Holden mentioned that psychosomatic symptoms occur in those who do not feel their early traumas in primals. Eventually, it becomes an either/or choice. Thus, one can feel the early Pain or one can suffer from the symptom. The cause of the symptom becomes clear to the patient during the re-experiencing as the patient begins to know why he has that particular psychosomatic symptom. The symptoms often have a deeper origin in earlier traumas, oftentimes in birth and even before.

"Sales Motivation: What are You Learning? The last few weeks, I’ve been spending a lot of time with very seasoned salespeople from several different industries. These are some very capable people who are professional and mature in their sales process. At the same time, though, their level of sales motivation is not always where it should be and their sales performance is not quite what it should be. My sense is the reason for these dynamics starts with their lack of initiative in learning each day more about their customers and more about their own sales process. I love asking the question, “What did you learn today and how will you use it tomorrow?” I love asking this question to get people thinking on a daily basis about the importance of continuous learning. The rate at which industries, the economy and other factors change is staggering. Salespeople who become complacent in their own self-discipline will inevitably fall behind the salespeople who are proactive. Take the time and initiative to actively learn about your customers — their needs, what has changed in their company or industry, new circumstances affecting their ability or inability to buy, etc. Also evaluate your own sales process to see where you can improve or change your technique for the better. Your sales motivation deserves this kind of attention. PrevPreviousSales Motivation: Are You Dealing with Prospects or Suspects?",https://thesaleshunter.com/sales-motivation-what-are-you-learning/

"When Donald Trump was asked to name the leaders of foreign terrorist groups earlier this month, he awkwardly stumbled and suggested it wasn’t important for him to know the difference between some of those groups. So you can forgive one of the most important conservatives setting the nation’s tax policy for being skeptical of Trump’s tax plan. “How serious it was surprised me. … Writing a piece of legislation, let alone tax legislation, is a very serious thing to do,” Grover Norquist, the founder and president of the group Americans for Tax Reform, told Business Insider in a conversation on Monday. Trump’s tax plan impressed Norquist, who is perhaps the single most important person in the conservative orbit for a Republican presidential candidate to impress on tax policy. Norquist crafted the famous “pledge” to not raise taxes, one that’s signed by the vast majority of Republican candidates. Trump’s plan, observers noted upon its release, was decidedly more conventional than his vague, more populist rhetoric on the campaign trail this summer might have suggested. It also conformed to the boundaries of Norquist’s pledge by being revenue neutral. Norquist identified one notable missing element for which conservatives often advocate in tax reform: Trump’s plan would not move closer to full expensing of business fixed investment, which refers to business investment in physical assets. Those assets are currently deducted over a span of several years – Norquist and other conservatives want those assets deducted in a single year. But Norquist praised the plan’s practicality. He said it would likely earn the support of every Republican in Congress, and noted it’s on the same page with plans and ideas from Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), the chair of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, and Sen. Orrin Hatch, the chair of the Senate Finance Committee.",https://www.businessinsider.sg/grover-norquist-donald-trump-tax-plan-2015-9/

"570 internet researchers from all over the world met at the conference of the Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR2016)in Berlin. According to the theme “Internet Rules!”, they discussed regulations of the Internet, how power structures as well as making and breaking rules work online and what challenges occur for the society. The conference, which took place in Germany for the first time, was hosted by the Hans-Bredow-Institut and the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society (HIIG). For four days, the participants of the AoIR discussed what rules and regulations the Internet needs. The topics ranged from ethics in digitalisation, data protection and the regulation of platforms to effects of social media on political decision-making. The keynote “The Platform Society” was given by Prof. Dr. José van Dijck of the University of Amsterdam. One highlight of the conference was the public panel discussion “Who Rules the Internet?“ on October 6 in the lecture hall of the Humboldt-Universität Berlin. Kate Crawford (Microsoft Research), Fieke Jansen (Tactical Tech) and Carolin Gerlitz (Universität Siegen) discussed power structures and regulatory structures on the Internet at this panel. Plenary Panel: Who Rules the Internet? The Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society (HIIG) aims at exploring the dynamic relationship between the Internet and society. It seeks to understand the interplay between social-cultural, legal, economic and technical norms in the process of digitalisation, and thus, form the basis for the dialogue of different interest groups of politics, business and society.

"Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa subsp. Chinensis), also known as bok choy or pak choi, is a green leafy vegetable native to China, where it has been cultivated for thousands of years. This winter-hardy vegetable is highly popular in China and Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam and the Philippines. Chinese cabbage has captured the attention of the western world in recent years due to to its highly nutritious leaves and stalks. Thanks to its varied and abundant concentrations of manganese, zinc, and vitamins A and C, Chinese cabbage can be considered a good source of antioxidants, which are helpful substances that play an important role in keeping the body’s cells healthy and protected from free radical damage. As a cruciferous vegetable, Chinese cabbage contains glucosinolates. These naturally occurring components give vegetables like Chinese cabbage a pungent aroma and health benefits that include inflammation reduction, detoxification support, and immune system stimulation. Chinese cabbage has the essential nutrients to keep osteoporosis at bay: calcium and phosphorus aid in bone mineralization, magnesium creates collagen, and vitamin K regulates the bone mineralization process. Moreover, a single cup of Chinese cabbage can deliver 64 percent of the recommended daily value of vitamin K and 16 percent of the recommended daily value of calcium, making it all the easier to prevent bone fractures. By working in conjunction with potassium, magnesium and calcium can naturally decrease blood pressure and keep it at a normal level. Note: Chinese cabbage is generally healthy but should be consumed in limited amounts or avoided by individuals with thyroid dysfunction. Like all cruciferous vegetables, Chinese cabbage has goitrogens or chemical compounds that can lead to goiter if taken regularly and in high amounts. In addition to lowering and steadying blood pressure, Chinese cabbage promotes heart health with vitamin B6 and folate. These two nutrients ensure that there is no buildup of homocysteine, a compound that has been linked to blood vessel damage. Furthermore, Chinese cabbage has zero cholesterol. The high vitamin C content in Chinese cabbage is good for the skin as well since vitamin C is necessary for collagen, the substance that renews and repairs skin. The easiest way to enjoy Chinese cabbage is as a simple stir fry. Chinese cabbage prepared this way can be eaten as is or served with tofu and meat to make it more substantial a meal. Apart from stir fry, Chinese cabbage does well in salads, wraps, sandwiches, and slaw. Note: when purchasing Chinese cabbage from the grocery, choose firm and fresh heads that feel heavy for their size. Avoid heads with leaves that appear bruised or wilted. Chinese cabbage is a low-calorie, nutrient-dense vegetable that contains a multitude of essential minerals and vitamins. The combination of nutrients makes it one of the best foods for supporting the heart and skin, and a good preventive measure against osteoporosis and high blood pressure. Individuals with thyroid disorders should consume Chinese cabbage sparingly or avoid it altogether because of the possible negative effects this vegetable may cause to the thyroid gland.",https://naturalpedia.com/chinese-cabbage-sources-health-benefits-nutrients-uses-and-constituents-at-naturalpedia-com.html
"Adsorption chiller technology is one of effective means to convert waste thermal energy into effective cooling, which substantially improves energy efficiency and lowers environmental pollution. This article develops an improved lump-parameter design model for multi-bed silica gel-water adsorption chillers. It is validated by experimental results stemming from a four-bed silica gel-water adsorption chiller at various operating conditions. We found that the performance predictions from this model compare favourably with experimental results. At rated conditions and over a wide range of cycle times, both the cooling capacity and COP can be predicted to within 10%. This indicates that the model can be used confidently as a design tool for multi-bed adsorption chillers.",http://ecite.utas.edu.au/94191

"With adaptive software, recommendation engines, supplemental homework exercises, and highly personalized lesson plans, we can help teachers personalize each student’s learning plan and work with parents to match her learning styles, fill skills gaps, and even help her enjoy school more. Each student approaches a subject differently, which means that a teacher working from a single textbook must do the best she can to help each child get the most from each chapter. She can use study questions, or her class discussion, to make sure each student understands the key concepts and how to use them. But what if the textbook were dynamic? What if each chapter could be adapted to match that student’s learning style? What if a student having trouble with a concept could simply click on a link to drill down into additional information on it, while the student who understands the concept quickly could click on a different link and spend time learning more about how that concept applies to real life problems? Being able to measure a student’s performance in real time (see “diagnosis”) helps teacher’s manage this challenge. Today, many online tools are “adaptive,” which means they match the kind of questions they ask, or the difficulty of those questions, to the student’s performance on earlier questions. For example, a child practicing single digit math facts may have trouble multiplying by eights. The teacher, noting the pattern of incorrect answers, can give him more practice with eights before moving on to two-digit multiplication. Across the classroom, the teacher may assign another student more problems with sevens, based on her results. Some online programs do this automatically. Online tools also help teachers break their classes into smaller groups, so that the teacher can provide each group with targeted instruction. In a math class, for example, online tools can help a teacher assign extra practice for students struggling with a particular algebra problem. For another group, the teacher might recommend extra credit story problems, or reading on how adults are using algebra and other mathematics in their professions. This kind of personalization improves engagement. Personalized learning can also be more efficient. In a class of 20 or 30 students, a typical lesson goes too slowly for some; too quickly for others. A teacher learns to balance her lessons, helping as many students advance as quickly as they can, without leaving others behind. The toughest part? A student can move from the top of the class, to the bottom of it, and back again, from lesson to lesson and week to week. With personalized lessons, fewer kids have down time while their classmates catch up, and other students are not advanced to a new concept until they’ve mastered the last one.",https://leadcommission.org/uses/personalization?page=4
"A fantasy novel, just in time before Halloween. Knights of Mythreth Book 1: The Knight’s Order has been quietly floating on the interwebs for awhile as an e-book, and I’d like to thank all the people who’ve taken an interest in it. You rock! I hope you liked it. Please consider leaving a review on Amazon, or where you bought it, and I will be inspired to finish Knights of Mythreth: Book 2 faster ;). Another good place to leave a review is on Goodreads. The book has been doing pretty well, and it’s all thanks to you! These numbers are pretty good considering it’s Book 1, no one knows of me, and it was released quietly. Thanks again to all of you who took an interest, and I hope you liked it enough to leave a review, and are looking forward to Book 2! Don’t worry, I’ll keep you updated on its progress. The 1st proof was too dark. The 2nd is better, but I’ve ordered a 3rd which should be the best. The 3rd proof has turned out really well. The 2nd proof looked washed out, and the lightning was still too purple. The 3rd proof isn’t too dark, or too washed out, and the lightning is the closest to bluish-purple out of all 3. I didn’t know printing could be so finicky. Hugh Pindur (the cover artist) was awesome and sent me updated files that will work better with the printer. Check out his art, it’s amazing! Update: The Knight’s Order e-book just went live on Scribd. as well. This one was a long wait (2.5 weeks before it was published). Amazon , Kobo , Apple iBooks , Barnes&Noble , 24 Symbols , Inktera , Thalia , AND Scribd. At some point I may sell it on my website. I’ll let you know if I do.

"A Spanish prelate has been arrested for allegedly stealing and leaking classified Vatican documents in the second such scandal to hit the secretive institution in three years. Monsignor Lucio Angel Vallejo Balda, who served on a special commission set up by Pope Francis to advise him on economic reform within the Vatican, was arrested as part of an investigation into the ""misappropriation and disclosure of classified documents and information"". The arrest followed Italian media reports at the weekend that Vatican police were investigating the attempted theft of a laptop belonging to Libero Milone, the head of the city state's new finance office. Balda was hauled in for questioning on Saturday along with a second member of the commission, Francesca Chaouquil, after a probe lasting several months, a Vatican statement said. Both were arrested but Chaouqui was released by Vatican prosecutor Roberto Zannotti on Monday because she agreed to collaborate with investigators and was not considered a flight risk. The Vatican also denounced the expected publication this week of two new books believed to be based on leaks from hackers releasing information regarding the famously murky world of its finances. And it referred to the last time employees aired the centuries-old institution's dirty laundry. In 2012, Pope Benedict XVI's butler engineered a series of leaks that revealed fierce infighting in the highest echelons of the Catholic Church and allegations of serious fraud in the running of the city state. ""As far as the books announced for the coming days go, it is clear that this time too, just as in the past, they are the fruit of a serious betrayal of the pope's trust,"" the statement said.",https://www.thelocal.es/20151102/spanish-prelate-arrested-in-return-of-vatileaks-scandal

"Statistics released today by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show the Northwest Arkansas metropolitan area had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation last month. The Northwest Arkansas area, which includes Benton, Madison and Washington counties in Arkansas and McDonald County, Mo., had an unemployment rate of 4.9 percent in September, down from 5.3 percent in August. Among 372 metropolitan areas in the U.S., Northwest Arkansas was among 41 with an unemployment rate below 5 percent. ""It's critical that we continue to grow jobs in Northwest Arkansas because we still have more than 11,000 people who want to go to work,"" said Mike Harvey, the Northwest Arkansas Council's chief operating officer. ""There remains much work to do when it comes to improving economic opportunity in our region."" Arkansas’ unemployment rate was 6.5 percent in September. That was an improvement over August’s 7 percent. In September 2011, the unemployment rate statewide was 7.7 percent. The nation’s unemployment rate in September was 7.6 percent. Meanwhile, the Northwest Arkansas region’s labor force continued to grow. There are 238,600 workers in the metropolitan area of Benton, Madison, Washington and McDonald counties.

"What is the proper way to backup before installing add-ons? Everybody always mentions backing up before you install a new contribution. I'm wondering what is the best way to achieve this? Should I just save my store in a zip file on my computer? ie. domain.com/store <--- Just take this entire directory? What about the database, should I back that up too, if so how? I intend to install several contributions so I want to make sure I'm doing the backup properly and efficiently if possible. edit: I meant to post this in osc. 2.x forum btw, if a mod would move it, that would be great! You should backup both your dBase & your files, dBase backup should be a regular thing anyway. Also add Database backup manager http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/5769 to replace the default tool, as that is bugged. For your site files, the easiest method is Backup of all store files in zip format http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/6986 though that is still in a rough state, either it will work on your site or not, though is it makes the backup file that will be good. I added that first contribution, is there a way to set that contribution to create backups on a schedule without me having to log into admin? I didn't add the 2nd one as I didn't quite grasp the installation instructions. I know you say the osc tool is buggy but if it still works then I hope I can do without this contribution. Also in terms of restoring the backup database..can it only be done via the existing tool? I once added a contribution and it wouldn't allow me to login to osc admin. In a situation like that, what would be done? I would still advise you add Database backup manager , the install only involves adding a function & replacing the existing osC file with the new. The original osC file can have failures on restore, so best to replace, with Database backup manager you can also do partial backups or restores (even with autobackup files). You can schedule backups with autobackup through a cron job, its detailed in the package. Also in terms of restoring the backup database..can it only be done via the existing tool? Backups can be restored via the admin tool, or through phpMyAdmin, or through your cpanel. If yoy have very large backups these methods may struggle, in which case just ask your host to do it. I set up the cron job for every 6 hours. Is that too much, too little? I added the autobackup and when I enable making zip of autobackup files, my entire shop gets messed (just white with no content). I'm guessing this is the part for store files and this feature is not for saving database zip files? Am I correct? I would suspect you forgot to upload the included zip function.",https://forums.oscommerce.com/topic/354343-what-is-the-proper-way-to-backup-before-installing-add-ons/

"Before THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE leaves the theater, just a few comments on its extraordinary run. Many of them had caveats like, ""the movie was great despite the Christian allegory,"" or ""the viewer can ignore the Christian aspects of the story and simply enjoy the great tale."" You would think the critics would have learned from Mel Gibson's PASSION OF THE CHRIST that there truly is a market out in the world for good family fare with a Christian subtext. Those critics that did not like the film panned its Christian roots or compared it to LORD OF THE RINGS and found it wanting. Major media commentators like Roeper and Ebert, and the New York Times liked the movie very much but seemed unable to figure out that the message is what made the movie--and it was an explicitly Christian message. My take on the comparison of Middle Earth to Narnia is that the film never tried to be Peter Jackson's masterpiece, just like Lewis never tried to be Tolkien. These are just completely different types of stories. Tolkien's is an epic and Lewis' is a fairy tale. Things work differently in each of these genres. THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE is just great moviemaking that is at its heart a kid's story that every adult can love. It talks about faith, about growing up, about being heroic, and about life after death. With the content lifted from the Gospel message, how can such an optimistic outlook go wrong. Answer--it can't. This film's success will ensure the rest of the stories become part of a worthy film franchise. Lastly, the critics' fear of Aslan, what he represents, and what the values he holds might do to viewers is perhaps one of the best things to come from this film. I took a lot of members of my parish to this movie. They got to see and hear the Gospel message in a new way, an exciting way. If they now see Christ as the Lion of Judah, so much the better. Let the critics beware; it looks like Aslan will be on the prowl for a long time to come.",https://anamchara.blogs.com/anamchara/2006/01/index.html
"Fire ruled an accident; cat rescued from one of houses. Two houses caught on fire in Northeast El Paso early Sunday morning in what fire officials are calling an accidental fire. The El Paso Fire Department was called out to a fire along the 5300 block of Annette Avenue at about 4 a.m. Sunday. When crews arrived, they found heavy smoke and flames coming from the back of one house and from the side of another. Firefighters began to simultaneously fight the fire and look for occupants. One of the houses was empty and the residents of the other were able to get out on their own. Firefighters rescued a cat from the empty house. Firefighters knocked down the fire at about 4:45 a.m. and continued to check for hot spots until about 5 a.m. The fire was confined to about 25 percent of one house, with damages estimated at about $55,000, and to 10 percent of the other house, with damages estimated at $12,000. The cause of the fire was accidental, fire officials said. No other details were available. A total of 11 units and 29 firefighters responded.

"Much like all of my readers, I encounter various forms of idiocy on a daily basis. Some might argue that the forms of idiocy that I encounter is magnified due to my living in the great Garden State, but I would argue that they’re wrong. What I’ve come to understand is that idiots are just idiots and it doesn’t matter where they live or what they do for a living! Case in point – the idiot at the local college’s bookstore. As some of you may remember, I teach at the local college. Well, two weeks ago was the first day of class and I just took over the teaching assignment for this class at the end of August. The problem with switching teaching assignments so close to the beginning of the school year is that the previous professor’s books are still the ones that are listed as the required texts – and I use different books. Thus, we have a problem. My students came to class on the first day and most of them had the wrong textbook with them. No problem, I thought. I told the students to go back to the bookstore and explain the issue and that it shouldn’t be a problem to get a refund and switch out the book that they bought with the correct one. I’ve worked with the bookstore before and they’re typically a good, easy-going bunch. However, I decided that since I was on vacation from my day job that after class that day I would walk over to the bookstore and just double check to be sure that the right books were assigned to my class section (they were). When I arrived at the bookstore, I noticed some of my students switching out their books, which was good. I asked one of the runners (they have students that run to the back to check on questions when they come up) if she could go and check my book assignments. By the response on this young girl’s face, you would have thought that I asked her to do high end calculus using nothing but an abacus. She responded with something like, “Oh… I don’t think I can do that, but let me ask my supervisor.” And before I could tell her not to worry about it, she was gone. Folks, the last thing I want to do as an adjunct professor on the first day of school is bother a supervisor in the bookstore. If you’ve ever been to a college bookstore on the first day of classes, it’s mayhem. The young girl came running back and said to follow her to the back. Immediately, I put my guard up because not only was this completely unnecessary, but I knew that whoever I was going to speak with was going to be irate at my presence.",http://www.jerseysmarts.com/tag/books-2/
